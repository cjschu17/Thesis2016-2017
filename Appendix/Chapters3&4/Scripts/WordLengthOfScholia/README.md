This script is designed to present descriptive and analytic statistics regarding the differences in length (as measured by words per scholion) among the scholia of the different zones.

It requires only one input: the [archival version of the scholia](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/VersionsOfScholia/archived-version.tsv).

The result of this script is a text file with two tables. The first table is a table of all the descriptive statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) for this dataset. This table can be found in the data section for Chapter 3, [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/ScholiaLengthData/scholiaLength.tsv). The second table is a compilation of the results of the Student's T-test along with whether the difference in average scholion length between two zones was statistically significant or not. This table can also be found in Chapter 3's data appendix, found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/ScholiaLengthData/tTestResults.tsv).
