Two scripts were required for the analysis of lemmata throughout the zones of the scholia. Both scripts required only a single input: the [archived version of the text](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/VersionsOfScholia/archived-version.tsv).

The first script [lemmaData.sc](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Scripts/lemmataScripts/lemmaData.sc) was designed to count how many lemma appear in the scholia, and more specifically how often lemmata appear at the beginning of each type of scholia. The script ultimately produces a table displaying the percentage of scholia from each zone which begin with a lemma. The final version of such a table can be seen in the Data section of the Chapter 3 appendix, found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/LemmataData/lemmaFreq.csv).

However, since so few lemmata ever appeared before non-main scholia, a script was written in order to investigate which specific non-main scholia were associated with lemmata. This is the purpose of the script [lemmaUrns.sc](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Scripts/lemmataScripts/lemmaUrns.sc). The result of this script is a text file that contains a list of urns of every non-main scholia which supposedly begins with a lemma. This text file can be found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/LemmataData/nonMainLemmataUrns.txt). The scholia compiled by this script were then investigated as to whether the lemma beginning a non-main scholion was legitimate or not. Since some were not found to be legitimate, the final data table seen in this part of the appendix (found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/LemmataData/lemmaFreq.csv) ) was adjusted such that it does not match exactly the table produced by the initial lemmaData.sc script.
