παράκειται τὰ Ἀριστονίκου σημεῖα καὶ τὰ  Διδύμου περι τῆς Ἀρισταρχείου διορθώσεως· τινὰ δὲ καὶ ἐκ τῆς Ἰλιακῆς προσωδίας Ἡρωδιανου καὶ ἐκ  τοῦ Νικάνορος περὶ στιγμης⁑
 
Lying beside [the text of the *Iliad*] are the following works. *The Signs* by Aristonicus, *On the Aristarchean Recension* by Didymus. And there is something from *Iliadic Prosody* by Herodian and *On Punctuation* by Nicanor.
