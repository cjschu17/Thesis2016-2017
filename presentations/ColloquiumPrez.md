## Brief History of the *Iliad* and Its Scholarship

- *Iliad* first orally composed, and multiple versions abound (2nd millennium B.C.E.)
- **Editors at Alexandrian Library produce a standardize text (3rd and 2nd c. B.C.E.)**
- **Venetus A manuscript created (10th c. C.E.)**
- Venetus A rediscovered by Villoison (late 18th c. C.E.)
- Homer Multitext project (21st c. C.E.)

παράκειται τὰ Ἀριστονίκου σημεῖα καὶ τὰ  Διδύμου περι τῆς Ἀρισταρχείου διορθώσεως· τινὰ δὲ καὶ ἐκ τῆς Ἰλιακῆς προσωδίας Ἡρωδιανου καὶ ἐκ  τοῦ Νικάνορος περὶ στιγμης⁑
 
Lying beside [the text of the *Iliad*] are the following works. *The Signs* by Aristonicus, *On the Aristarchean Recension* by Didymus. And there is something from *Iliadic Prosody* by Herodian and *On Punctuation* by Nicanor.

**By understanding the layout of and sources for the Venetus A two things can be accomplished:**
1. bridge the thousand year gap in scholarship between Alexandrians and Venetus A creation
2. by refining what information hails from the Alexandrians, shed light on pre-Alexandrian scholarship

## Five-zoned Layout of the Scholia

![Folio12Again](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/images/DSE.jpg)

- Yellow: Main
- Blue: Intermarginal
- Green: Interior
- Gray: Interlinear
- Red: Exterior
---
## Methodology

- Distant reading over close reading
  - "macro" over "micro" analysis
 
 - Scholia is a huge corpus (148,978 words)
 
 ---
 ## LDA Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlect Allocation)
 
 - uncovering the repeating patterns of co-occurring words within a text
 - requires a heavily prepared corpus
   - elimination of common words 
     - e.g. "the", "he", "am", etc.
   - reduction of multiple forms of a word into a single form 
     - e.g. reducing "singing", "sang", "sung" to "sing"
