This script is designed to present descriptive and analytic statistics regarding the differences in length (as measured by words per scholion) among the scholia of the different zones.

It requires only one input: the [archival version of the scholia](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/VersionsOfScholia/archived-version.tsv).

The result of this script is a text file with two tables. The first table is a table of all the descriptive statistics
