The data presented here relates to the frequency of personal names appearing within the text of the scholia. It was hoped that by collecting such information, some conclusions about the content of different zones of the scholia.

The [histograms folder](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/NameData/HistogramsOfScholiaTypes) present data tables which list every personal name that appears within each zone of the zone. So there is one data table for the main scholia, one for the intermarginal scholia, and so on. 

The [differences folder](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/NameData/Difference) contains data tables which, based on data from the [histograms folder](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/NameData/HistogramsOfScholiaTypes), identify the differences in the presence of personal names between the different types of scholia.
