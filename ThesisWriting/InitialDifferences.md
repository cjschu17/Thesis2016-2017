The five zones of the Venetus A look different. Beyond their obviously different locational differences on the manuscript page, some are written in a different style of handwriting, and the average length of a single scholion differs quite dramatically. An interlinear scholion typically has no more than a few words, while some main scholia take up the entirety of the upper margin. However, it is entirely possible that these differences are coincidental or unimportant. Does it really make a difference that the main scholia and intermarginal scholia differ in handwriting styles (Hecquet, 79-80)? What scholars want to know about the placement of a comment within a particular zone of the scholia is the information, "presumably about the source(s) of the comment" which is conveyed by its placement (Ebbott, 2012). For example, are many intermarginal scholia really just abbreviated versions of main scholia, as Dindof asserts (CITE).

As discussed, however, Dindorf's methodology is outdated. The entirety of the previous chapter was devoted to describing the methods required to prepare a text for analysis beyond the close-reading which dominated literary analysis in the past. After a thorough process of text wrangling, the Homeric scholia can be analyzed with the aid of a computer. It is important to note that, in conjunction with the previous discussion of creating different citable versions of the same text, that this text wrangling is not in any way altering the original archival data from the Homer Multitext. Rather, the process of text wrangling creates a different version of the same text. A completely parsed version of the first main scholion of Book 1 would still be recognizable as the first main scholion of Book 1 and should be cited as such, but it is clearly not the same text. It should be cited as a parsed edition of that scholion. Thus when the various forms of the text were being modified, it was important to always attach some urn identifier to every scholion so that the scholia maintained their identity throughout the process.

As for applying the "distant-reading" described by Jocker's, its implementation takes on multiple forms. On the one hand, some of the points made in this thesis were made simply by taking descriptive statistics about the dataset, e.g. how many times does a particular name appear in the main scholia? While this figure would not be impossible to come up with by hand, it is far easier to accomplish with a computer. Particularly since the goal of this thesis is to understand the differences in purpose between the zones of scholia. So knowing that there are the most occurrences of the name Aristarchus could simply be the result of there being the most words in the main scholia. Thus in order to compare the appearances of Aristarchus in the main and itnermarginal scholia, it is necessary to normalize the frequency by dividing the occurrences of a name's appearance in a zone of scholia by the total number of words within that type of scholia. Whereas finding out how many times Aristarchus appears in the main scholia is a feasible, yet annoying statistic on the magnitude of hundreds, finding out how many words are in the main scholia would be practically infeasible on the magnitude of ten thousands. Thus, even fairly simple inquiries require digital technologies when the corpus becomes large enough as in the case of the Venetus A's scholia.

However, not all inquiries can be approached so easily. When trying to determine whether the textual content among the scholia zones is at all similar, there is no simple calculation that one could work through by hand, especially when the corpus becomes so large. In this case, it was necessary to defer to the algorithms developed by others. For this particular inquiry, topic modelling was used extensively in order to highlight in what ways the content of the scholia was quantitatively different. Specifically, I relied on the Latent Dirichlect Allocation (LDA) model of topic modelling. The proof that LDA works and an explanation of its precise mechanism is far too technical and beyond the scope of this thesis. Here, though, I will provide a general outline of how the model works. Then I will discuss some of the issues trying to work with data from topic modelling and my attempts to mitigate these issues.

The basic assumption behind topic modelling is that any and all texts vary to some degree in their content. Whether a text be a novel, or whether it be a group of historical documents, a text varies in its contents. If there were no variation, it would not be a text but a single word repeated over and over again. So, in a simple example, a work like the *Iliad* contains descriptive passages ranging from a duel, a chariot race, lamentation, arming for battle, insulting, and so on. While such changes in scene are obvious to someone with some reading comprehension skills, it is hard to quantify exactly what makes these various scenes different. Thus topic modelling aims at using digital technologies to identify the different topics which end up contributing to the entirety of the text. So in following with the above example, one running a topic model on sections of the Iliad might expect to find a topic devoted to the language of prayer and another topic devoted to the language of battle. A "topic" is more than just a general label for a section of a text, but practically in topic modelling it refers to a set of vocabulary items that the computer has recognized as frequently occurring together in particular order again and again. In reality, topic modelling assumes that a text is written in a peculiar fashion. The model assumes that an author has at their disposal a number of different "topics," which is just a set of vocabulary, and that the author draws from these various topics in order to compose the final text. Thus, the goal of topic modelling is to uncover these specific "topics." 

This model is designed to overcome the fact that computers do not read like humans. To cite a popular example, the two phrases "time flies like an arrow" and "fruit flies like an apple" would seem nearly identical to a computer which can only recognize if the characters which make up words are equivalent. Thus by treating a potential corpus as just a seemingly random assembly of words, topic modelling is able to identify the reoccurring patterns of cooccurring words which define topics. To reiterate from the previous chapter's discussion of text wrangling, it should be clear now why having a clean corpus of text is necessary for topic modelling. If the modelling relies on the cooccurrence of words, then it is important that the variants forms of a word be reduced into a simplified lemma. Otherwise important lingustic cooccurrences might be left out of the analysis.

Before progressing further in this discussion of topic modelling a final point should be made about the nature of "topics." As stated previously, topics are a set of vocabulary items that an algorithm has identified as constituting a recurring pattern of cooccurring terms. As such, "topics" in their most basic sense, do not have to confer information about subject matter. In some cases, topic modelling can be used to identify differences in an author's style. Thus the "topics" would not be collections of words relating to a particular subject, but rather a collection of words that might give information about a particular author's style.

More about topic modelling, and the problems it poses for replicable and reliable scholarship, will be said when discussing the application of topic modelling to the questions of this thesis. For now, I want to return to the scholia and how forms of simpler implementations of digital technologies can aid in the answering certains questions about the scholia. At the most basic level, this thesis is concerned with observing in what way the zones of scholia are different. So finding fairly basic metrics about the scholia can be helpful, like the average length of a scholion. Even a cursory look at the scholia would yield the conclusion that the main scholia, on average are longer than interlinear scholia. While it is most likely that this difference is due largely to the amount of space available, it is probable that what the scholiast wants to say effects where he will place a comment. The limited space close to the text makes glosses and paraphrases a perfect fit for the interlinear scholia. By contract, the immensity of space and distance from the text makes in-depth conversations about mythology and history a good fit for the main scholia.

Where these observations become less clear is in the interior and intermarginal scholia. For all intents and purposes, these two scholia share the same amount of space on the manuscript page, and to the naked eye, the individual comments tend to be about equal in length. Here, then, is the advanage of digital technologies. The current data from the Homer Multitext archive includes the comletely edited edition of seventeen books from the Venetus A edition of the *Iliad* including all the scholia from that book. The only books missing from this analysis are books 13, 16, and 20-24. Even with an incomplete corpus of scholia, the HMT edition of the scholia includes (NUMBER OF WORDS IN THE SCHOLIA) words, which is a sizable enough corpus that members of the HMT feel comfortable asserting that this sample will be representative of the entire corpus of Venetus A scholia. It should be noted that since the scripts which were used to create this data are included in the GitHub repository for my thesis work, any and all of these results should be updated once the entirety of the Venetus A scholia are edited and made available. With all that said, it is time to turns to the data.


| Type of Scholia | Count | Median | Mean | Standard Deviation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Main Scholia | 3601 | 24 | 33.78 | 31.06 |
| Intermarginal Scholia | 1220 | 6 | 7.1 | 3.97 |
| Interior Scholia | 819 | 7 | 7.66 | 5.74 |
| Interlinear Scholia | 2067 | 2 | 2.31 | 1.88 |
| Exterior Scholia | 233 | 1 | 4.19 | 28.56 |

The above chart describes the length of scholia, grouped by scholia zone. Length here is defined by the number of words in the scholia. In all these calculations, only the actual comment of the scholia was considered, so the words of the lemma were not included in the various calculations. As discussed above, the main scholia are unsurprisingly the longest scholia, with the average scholion consisting of 33.78 words, and the interlinear scholia are unsurprisingly the shortest scholia, with the average scholion consisting of 2.31 words. The main and interlinear scholia also sit at the two extremes for the values of standard deviation. The large variance for the main scholia is expected as some main scholia are as short as a few words, while others easily go on for at least one hundred words. Again, this fits the accepted view of the main scholia's function in providing space for expanded discussions of grammar, mythology, etc. as well as more clipped notes. On the other hand, the low standard deviation for the interlinear scholia (1.88), combined with its low mean number of words (2.31) confirms the mathces the expectation that the interlinear scholia are mostly used to provide short glosses on words and phrases in the *Iliad* text.

As discussed above, however, confirming that the main and interlinear scholia are definitively different from one another is not necessarily that exciting. What would be of more interest would be a significant difference between the intermarginal and interior scholia. Just based on the descriptive statistics, the two do not appear all that different. Both have a average length of about 7 words, though the interior are a bit longer on average (7.66 words on average for the interior versus 7.1 words for the intermarginal). However, the standard deviation for the two throws uncertainty over the significance of this slight difference. With a standard deviation of 5.74 for the interior and 3.97 for the intermarginal, the two sets of scholia definitely overlap in terms of scholia length. Since it is not apparent from just looking at the descriptive statistics, inferential statistics are required in order to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the average length of the intermarginal scholia and the average length of the interior scholia.

| Types of Scholia | t-value | Statistically Significant (for p < 0.05, t > 1.645) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main and Intermarginal | 50.35 | Statistically Significant |
| Main and Interior | 47.06 | Statistically Significant |
| Main and Interlinear | 60.61 | Statistically Significant |
| Main and Exterior | 15.24 | Statistically Significant |
| **Intermarginal and Interior** | **2.44** | **Statistically Significant** |
| Intermarginal and Interlinear | 39.56 | Statistically Significant |
| Intermarginal and Exterior | 1.55 | not statistically Significant |
| Interior and Interlinear | 26.14 | Statistically Significant |
| Interior and Exterior | 1.84 | Statistically Significant |
| Interlinear and Exterior | 1.01 | not statistically Significant |

The above table is the result of a Welch's t-Test, which is able to compare to samples of data in order to conclude if the difference in their means are statistically significant. Since the number of scholia is so large, with the lowest occurring zones being the 233, it was assumed that there were essentially infinite degrees of freedom when conducting these tests. Unsurprsingly, given the previous discussion, the difference between the main and interlinear scholia was extremely significant, with a t-score of 60.61. In fact, all the t-tests where the main scholia were one of the sets of data were extremely statistically significant. This only reaffirms the fact already put forth by scholars that the main scholia are home to a particular set of scholia that are not found in the other zones of scholia.

To return to the intermarginal and interior scholia, a t-Test found there to be a statistically significant difference between the two's mean length as well. Thus, even without knowing anything about what the scholia actually say, one can confidently assert that there is a difference between the intermarginal and interior scholia. The difference may be slight, but it exists. At the very least, this difference suggests that there was a systematic way of placing scholia in the interior zone over the intermarginal zone. There seem to be two plausible explanations for this. On the one hand, the scholiast could be working with a single source which supplies all of the scholia for the interior and intermarginal scholia. However, the scholiast reserves the interior scholia for only certain types of comments from the single source, while the intermarginal is reserved for other types of comments. Alternatively, the two zones of the scholia are composed of comments arising from two different sources. This dual-source theory is the simpler explanation, and therefore the more attractive one, but it is difficult with the evidence provided so far to conclude that the intermarginal and interior scholia were composed from different sources. Thus, the most one can say at this point is that there was some system to placing scholia into the intermarginal and interior scholia. By contrast, if the two came from comments contained in a single source which were then randomly assigned to the two zones, there should not be 401 more intermarginal scholia than interior scholia - the two zones would have a more equal distribution were they randomly assigned to a zone.

As for the rest of t-tests, it is unsurprising that most of them demonstrate that there are statistically significant differences between the types of scholia. Only two of the tests could not demonstrate that the types of scholia were significantly different. However, both of the instances involved the exterior scholia, a particularly confusing zone of scholia. As the descriptive statistics demonstrate, the median length of a exterior scholion is one, but its mean is 4.19 and its standard deviation 28.56. This suggests that there are a few exterior scholia which are extremely wordy, and that these outliers are skewing the data. In fact, while at least half of the exterior scholia are just a single word, there is one exterior on folio 154v that is composed of 436 words. Such an extreme outlier is without a doubt skewing the data. So for the t-test between intermarginal and exterior scholia, I am confident that once the entirety of the Venetus A scholia are included in this analysis, the increased dataset will offset this extreme outlier. Still, below is the results of the same t-test, but with that single exterior outlier removed from the dataset. As predicted, with this removal the difference between intermarginal and exterior became statistically significant. Thus, there should be no doubt that the zones of scholia contains different types of comments.

Types of Scholia|T-value|Statistically Significant (for p < 0.05, t > 1.645)
--- | --- | ---
Main and Exterior|56.92|Statistically Significant
Intermarginal and Exterior|21.25|Statistically Significant
Interior and Exterior|19.14|Statistically Significant
Interlinear and Exterior|0.11|not statistically Significant

I^fn1 believe the same thing is happening with the exterior and interlinear scholia t-test. I believe the exterior is so sensitive to this outlier just because the outlier is two orders of magnitude greater than the mean, and while there are 233 exterior scholia, a fairly large sample size, it is still least frequently occurring of all the types of scholia in the manuscript. So in sum,
