---

Reading this thesis is more than just becoming more familiar with the *Iliad*, its history of scholarship, and newer developments in the digital era. More generally, reading this thesis begins the process of engaging with a text. Like all texts, this thesis has two primary components: the textual content and its formattting or presentation. While the content should reign as king in an undergraduate research thesis, the formatting is just as important for relaying the information contained within these pages. 

Admittedly, the presentation of my information is not particularly noteworthy, and thus it may appear that claiming my presentation to be as important as my content is a bit far-fetched. On the contrary, my presentation is not noteworthy precisely because I chose to present my content in the exact same way as countless others have before me. That is, I am writing text in a single conlumn that will extend onto many pages whose text will be split up into paragraphs. Overall, most readers probably would never spend more than a few seconds pondering the formatting of this material since it follows the manner of publication that has been the standard for centuries. However, if I chose to write this thesis in two-columns without any paragraph breaks, I should not expect many people to read much beyond the first few lines.

In either case it should be clear that formatting matters when it comes to fashioning an effective text. I raise the reader's attention to the now-standard method of creating books in print precisely because the two texts which lie at the heart of this thesis apply methods of publication which were the standard in their own day, but far different from that of today. On the one hand is the epic poem the *Iliad*. In its modern incarnation, the *Iliad* runs about fifteen thousand lines as a printed text. The *Iliad*, however, was not originally a printed text; rather, its arose out of an oral tradition which dates back nearly three thousand years. 

On the other hand is the tenth-century C.E. Venetus A manuscript which contains one such written version of the *Iliad*, and one which is the oldest complete version in existence. As if its age were not impressive enough, each page of the manuscript is replete with a wealth of scholarly notes, or scholia, which provide a running commentary on the poem. These scholia are split up among five different margins of the manuscript such that they utterly surround the text on each manuscript page. This is a far cry from the modern system of footnoting which relegates similar scholarly notes to the bottom margin of the page, giving the impression that the footnotes are less important than the regular text. On the contrary the scholia of the Venetus A are so all-encompassing that it is hard to view them in the same dismissive light as modern footnotes. 

It is precisely the format of these scholia, their division amongst the various margins of the manuscript page, which will become the focus of this thesis. The overall goal of this research was to use digital technologies to investigate what sort of relationship existed, if any, between a scholion's position within a particular margin and its content. Beyond a curiosity in the creation of this manuscript, this line of inquiry does have broader implications for the field of Homeric studies. More is needed to be saidin this preface about the nature of the Venetus A and its scholia before these implications can be fully understood. For now, however, it is sufficient to say that if it can be shown that particular margins of the manuscript are strongly correlated with particular discussions of Iliadic scholarship, then one might be able to state more definitively what the sources are for the scholia in each particular margin.

Why precisely this inquiry into the sources of the scholia is of any importance is ultimately the purpose of this first chapter. Chapter two will detail the general methodology of how I was able to analyze the corpus of Venetus A scholia, while chapter four will detail more in-depth the actual analysis and initial. Finally, the concluding chapter will contextualize the more significant results from the third chapter and explain how my findings help to shed light on the creation of the Venetus A as well as on the a critical point in the evolution of Homeric poetry.

Before going any further, it is necessary to ground my work in that of previous scholars and to clarify my assumptions towards the figure known as Homer. The common sense opinion was that an ancient Greek known as Homer *wrote* the two seminal epics of the Western literature, the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*. However, the scholarly opinion is much more divided. On the one hand is the opinion put forth by the eminent classical scholar Martin West in his 1998 critical edition of the *Iliad*. For West, the *Iliad*, "was the work of a single poet of the greatest ability" (*unius munus fuit maximi poetae*, v), and it was written (*Ilias... conscripta est*, v).

This opinion is by no means the dominant opinion. As far back as the first centruy C.E. the Jewish historian Josephus makes the claim that the poems were not written down originally but were composed as songs. Over a long span of time these songs were rememembered and eventually written down (Josephus, Against Apion, 1.2). This oral theory took on a whole new life in the late eighteenth century with the writings of Friedrich Wolf. In his 1795 preface to *Iliad*, Wolf not only expands on the theory put forth by Josephus and others, but goes one step further. Wolf suggests boldly that:
      
      ...this entire connected series of the two continuous poems is owed less to genius of him to whom we have normally attributed it, than to the zeal of a more polite age and the collective efforts of many, and that therefore the very songs from which the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* were assembled do not all have one common author... (Wolf, 70)

This is a view which Wolf himself says "one must accept" (70) and which I believe holds greater weight than that of West. Not only does Wolf acknowledge the importance of songs for the creation and spread of the two poems, but he does away with even the idea of a single poet, something which Josephus still seemed to believe existed. For Wolf and for his followers, there is no Homer and there is no single poet. To be fair to West, he acknowledges the key role of song and rhapsodes in proliferating the epic poems (*Ilias materiam continet iamdiu per ora cantorum diffusam*, v), but he diverges most importantly from the view of Wolf and other oral theorists in his assertion that even these songs "first got the form and cohesion as we know them at that time when it was written" by that single poet (v).

The idea that the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* were originially composed as songs for performance is one that has persisted far beyond Wolf. More and more scholars are stating more confidently than Wolf their new evidences which force the figure of "Homer" to yield his genius to a tradition of oral poets. One of the most notable contributions in this respect comes from the collaboration of Milman Parry and Albert Lord in the early twentieth century. The pair studied the living oral poetic tradition of Yugoslovia in order to learn much about the form of living traditional oral poetry so that, when approaching an oral poem like the *Iliad*, one could "work backwards from the form so as to learn how they must have been made" (Lord, 3). The two asserted that this oral poetry of the Slavic people was not simply poetry being read aloud, but rather poetry which was being composed in its performance (Lord, 5). Furthermore, it was based on their comparative study of the nature of the Slavic traditional oral poems and their understanding of the formulaic nature of the Homeric poems that the pair concluded that the Homeric poems are oral poems (Lord, 141).

Regardless of their origin it is plainly obvious that at some point in time the epics were written down. Gregory Nagy laid out his model for the evolution of Homer from an oral composition to the fixed text we have today in his book *Homeric Questions*. In it, Nagy notes that the *Iliad* was probably first beginning to be transcribed sometime during the sixth-century B.C.E., which would be at least a few centuries after the poem was first being composed as a performed oral poem (Nagy, 42). Nagy accounts for Greeks' attribution of the poem to the creative figure known as "Homer" by noting that this would not be the first time the Greeks attributed a large societal achievement to a single "cultural hero," (Nagy, 21). So just as often Greek lawmakers are reconstructed "as the originators of the sum total of customary law as it evolved through time. So also with Homer: he is retrojected as the original genius of epic" (Nagy, 21).

Once the text was written down, it is clear from antiquity that the Homeric poems were well-known, well-respected, and well-read.  The poems were seen as so important that in the third and second centuries B.C.E., three separate heads of the Library at Alexandria took it upon themselves to edit the texts of Homer. So even though the historical figure of Homer and an original written version of the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* never existed, these three ancient editors committed themselves to try and recover a text that was meant by the poet. These Alexandrian editors began a tradition of editing to discover the poet's voice that continues through to today with West's edition of the *Iliad*. Again, it was Wolf's insights into the nature that cast a shadow upon the virtue of such a process. If Homer truly does not exist and the epic poems were composed-in-performance repeatedly by oral poets across Greece for centuries, "what, then, will it mean to restore these poems to their original luster and genuine beauty?" (Wolf, 70). To expand on Wolf's question, how can one represent in a print medium a poem which, by nature of its strictly oral origins, was recomposed with every performance, thus leading to the creation of distinct *Iliads* and *Odysseys*?

An effective solution to this editing problem would only come two centuries later with the creation of the Homer Multitext project. Put briefly, the Homer Multitext abandons the medium of print altogether. In an article detailing the editorial standards of their project, the two main editors of the Homer Multitext, Casey Dué and Mary Ebbott, the fuller representation of the Homeric epics' oral tradition exists in digital medium. As suggested by Wolf, the goal of editing the Homeric epics is not to create a poem as its "author" knew it. Rather the editors of the Homer Multitext are interested in preserving all extant versions of the Homeric poems. So whereas variants in the manuscript tradition of Cicero, Vergil, or of any work which is known to have an original written form, is treated as an opportunity to suss out which of the variants is the "correct reading," variants in the Homeric epic do not necessarily imply that one or other variant is incorrect. Rather, it is entirely valid that different manuscripts record differences in the poem that arise from differences in the performances by the different rhapsodes across time. As Dué and Ebbott recall, "The singers themselves do not strive to innovate, but they nevertheless compose a new song each time" (1). As such, the Homer Multitext strives to create a version of the Homeric texts which presents the an editor's favorite selection of variants from all the different manuscripts, but rather wishes to present all the variant readings of the epics together and without preference. To that end, the project refers to the variants as "multiforms," a term originated by Albert Lord because the term "multiform" refrains from giving any preference to a particular reading and "it acknowledges that [an] idea may exist in several forms" (cited in Dué and Ebbott).

As for the actual architecture of the digital editions created by the Homer Multitext project, more will be explained in the second chapter on methodology when it is more relevant. For now it is more important to discuss the general philosophy behind their editions. Again, the Homer Multitext is not lookign to present a critical edition like Martin West's 1998 edition. Critical editions aim to provide a single version of a text. The Homer Multitext on the other hand uses digital technologies precisely because a digital format "can more readily handle multiple texts" (Dué and Ebbott, 1). In order to have multiple texts at hand, multiple texts need to be digitized. It is in this process of digitally transcribing the text of individual manuscripts that the Homer Multitext spends most of its time. The project commits itself to creating diplomatic editions of individual manuscripts. Where, as mentioned, a critical edition aims to provide the "correct" reading of a manuscript, a diplomatic edition aims to recreate the text of the manuscript exactly as it appears. It is only by exactly trascribing a series of manuscripts that the multiformity of the epic poems can be fully preserved.

What makes any of this work possible is the digitization of photography of various manuscripts under a Creative Commons License. Centuries-old manuscripts are extremely fragile documents that require particular environmental requirements in order to maintain their condition. As such, manuscripts are difficult to access, especially for Americans as most manuscripts are held in libraries in Europe. So gaining the opportunity to handle any manuscript long enough to fully transcribe it would be next to impossible. However, a rising trend in digitally photographing entire manuscripts has allowed for increased access to manuscript for all scholars.

Even though the photography allows the manuscripts to be perenially available, it is unavoidable that, even with as large a team as the Homer Multitext project has, transcribing an entire manuscript of the *Iliad* takes a good deal of time. As such, project members come to spend so much more time with these manuscripts compared to other Classical scholars that the number of new conlcusions reached concerning the creation behind these manuscripts is unsurprising. However, the amount of scholarship produced by project members cannot just be explained by the amount of time they spend with the manuscripts. It must also be  attributed to the complexity of the manuscripts themselves as well as the problems of interpretation they pose. 

Nowhere is this level of interpretational complexity more apparent than in the case of the aforementioned Venetus A manuscript and its many, many scholia. To repeat information from before, the Venetus A is an extremely important document for the field of Homeric studies for a number of reasons. For one, it contains the entire text of the *Iliad* and, since it dates back to the tenth century C.E., it is the oldest existing manuscript to do so. Still, it is the scholia which have caught the attention of scholars for centuries. For a variety of reasons, including the rise of the printing press, the Venetus A was essentially forgotten around the time of the Renaissance (Blackwell and Dué, 6). However, once it was rediscovered by Jean Baptiste Gaspard d’Ansse de Villoison in the late 1700s, news of the manuscript and scholia spread quickly among Homeric scholars. Wolf reports that Villoison’s edition of the manuscript was one of the most anticipated works of the era (CITATION NEEDED).

[Insert here more from Wolf and Dindorf on why these scholia are of particular importance. Critical signs, and views into the Alexandrians].

While this discussion could continue without any images, one of the hallmarks of the Homer Multitext project is its focus on visual evidence. Furthermore, as the discussion of the scholia begins in earnest, it is important to keep in mind that the scholia are more than just textual content. The text of scholia are like any other text, and therefore its format and presentation are just as crucial to their understanding as the actual Greek words.
[Picture of folio 12r]

Pictured above is the first page, or folio, of the Venetus A manuscript which contains text of the *Iliad*. Admittedly, this folio, folio 12 recto, is a misrepresentation of the average manuscript page as few folii come close to rivaling 12r in terms of scholia density. Still, due to this exaggerated density, it is a very useful folio for demonstrating the general layout of the manuscript.

[Picture of folio 12r, but with the DSE showing different colors, this one only highlighting the text]

In the middle of every manuscript page, highlighted in the picture above, are the verses of the *Iliad* and almost every folio contains exactly twenty-five lines of the poem. Every other mark or letter that is not highlighted in the above picture consitutes this folio's scholia. 

[Picture of folio 12r, but with the DSE showing different colors, this one highlighting the different scholia zones]

Even for someone who did not know any Greek, it is clear the scholia do not form a singular document. Rather the scholia are divided into five distinct zones. As, but as Mary Ebbott notes in a 2011 talk on the the Venetus A and multiformity, "It's impossible to just read it from top to bottom, left to right" (2011).

[Picture of folio 12r, but with the DSE showing different colors, this one highlighting the different scholia zones]
The above picture illustrates more easily the five distinct sets of scholia, as each color represents a different set. As one can see from the distribution, the different sets of scholia are distributed evenly among the manuscript, but rather each set occupies a unique zone of the manuscript page. The naming conventions for each set of scholia are rather straightforward as a set’s name intuitively reflects its position on the page. Thus those [COLOR] scholia located in between the *Iliad* text and the binding of the codex are referred to as the interior scholia. Similarly the [COLOR] scholia located on the outer edge furthest from the codex are the exterior scholia. The main set of scholia, located in the primary margin and highlighted in [COLOR] are simply referred to as the main scholia. The scholia highlighted in [COLOR], located in the margin between the *Iliad* text and the main scholia are the intermarginal scholia. Finally, the scholia highlighted in [COLOR] which are located in between the lines of the *Iliad* are simply referred to as the interlinear scholia. 

There are many questions which rise naturally from viewing this unique five-zoned layout Is the division between the sets of scholia always this rigid? How do the scholia interact with the *Iliad* lines on a single page of the manuscript? Are there any meaningful differences in content between the various sets of scholia? If so, is there any indication that each set of scholia derives from its own source?  These and other questions are the very inquiries which sit at the core of this thesis. While most of the answers to the questions can only be answered 

Not every folio of the Venetus A contains every type of scholia, but every folio follows this format and rarely do sets of scholia venture outside of their distinctive zones. The following folio serves as an example of this principle.

[Include a picture of a folio with an abundance of main scholia with little to no exterior scholia…. So most Venetus A pages. In particular I am thinking of that extremely dense on from Book 18, 148r]

Folio [148 recto], shown above, is a rather dense page, but it is not equally dense among all the different sets of scholia. While there is a plethora of main scholia, there are [only a few/no] exterior scholia. The scribe of the manuscript could have easily relieved some of his stress in trying to fit so many main scholia onto a single page by extending his writing into the zone of the exterior. This, however, is not the case and the main scholia stay rigidly within the same zone it occupied on the even more crowded folio 12r. This principle of placing scholia 

 even if a particular folio should have an overabundance of main scholia, the scribe will not spill over into the space which the exterior scholia usually
