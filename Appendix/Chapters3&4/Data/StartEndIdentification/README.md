Here are located the files related to the identification of which scholia from the intermarginal and interior zones should be classified as either start-of-line scholia or end-of-line scholia. For more information about why there is a need to investigate which model, the intermarginal/interior or the start/end-of-line model, is more accurate for these two zones of teh scholia, please see [Chapter 4](). Start-of-line scholia are simply intermarginal or interior scholia which occupy the space to the left of the *Iliad* text, while end-of-line scholia are intermarginal or interior scholia occupying the space to the right of the *Iliad* text.

While it is easy to recognize whether a scholion is an end-of-line or start-of-line scholion while looking at the manuscript, I needed to compile a list which designated each scholion as either start-of-line or end-of-line. The starting point was the index of every scholion to the folio it appears on. This is found in the file [scholToFolioIndx.csv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/StartEndIdentification/scholToFolioIndx.csv).

On verso folios, intermarginal scholia are classified as start-of-line scholia and interior scholia are classified as end-of-line scholia. On recto folios, intermarginal scholia are classified as end-of-line scholia and interior scholia are classified as start-of-line scholia. 

Knowing this allowed me to create four individual classifications of these scholia. These are: scholia which are both intermarginal and start-of-line (found in the file [startImUrns.txt](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/StartEndIdentification/startImUrns.txt) ), scholia which are both intermarginal and end-of line (found in the file [endImUrns.txt](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/StartEndIdentification/endImUrns.txt) ), scholia which are both interior and start-of-line (found in the file [startIntUrns.txt](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/StartEndIdentification/startIntUrns.txt) ), and scholia which are both interior and end-of-line (found in the file [endIntUrns.txt](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/StartEndIdentification/endIntUrns.txt) ).
