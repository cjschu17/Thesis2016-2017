Here are datatables which present which scholia have a significantly strong relationship with the various topics which were identified by the ToPan topic modelling software. We defined a "significantly strong relationship" as the scholion having a theta-score of greater than 0.9 with regards to a certain topic. These specific topics came from the first run of the topic model (data from this run can be found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/TopicModelData/ToPanVisualizations/Run1) ). Each of the 15 datatables corresponds to one of the 15 topics identified by that run of ToPan.

Each of the tables has two columns. The first column of every row presents the urn identifier for the scholion of interest, while the second column presents the theta-score quantifying that scholion's relationship to the topic of interest.
