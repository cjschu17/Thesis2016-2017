The five zones of the Venetus A look different. Beyond their obviously different locational differences on the manuscript page, some are written in a different style of handwriting, and the average length of a single scholion differs quite dramatically. An interlinear scholion typically has no more than a few words, while some main scholia take up the entirety of the upper margin. However, it is entirely possible that these differences are coincidental or unimportant. Does it really make a difference that the main scholia and intermarginal scholia differ in handwriting styles (Hecquet, 79-80)? What scholars want to know about the placement of a comment within a particular zone of the scholia is the information, "presumably about the source(s) of the comment" which is conveyed by its placement (Ebbott, 2012). For example, are many intermarginal scholia really just abbreviated versions of main scholia, as Dindof asserts (CITE).

As discussed, however, Dindorf's methodology is outdated. The entirety of the previous chapter was devoted to describing the methods required to prepare a text for analysis beyond the close-reading which dominated literary analysis in the past. After a thorough process of text wrangling, the Homeric scholia can be analyzed with the aid of a computer. It is important to note that, in conjunction with the previous discussion of creating different citable versions of the same text, that this text wrangling is not in any way altering the original archival data from the Homer Multitext. Rather, the process of text wrangling creates a different version of the same text. A completely parsed version of the first main scholion of Book 1 would still be recognizable as the first main scholion of Book 1 and should be cited as such, but it is clearly not the same text. It should be cited as a parsed edition of that scholion. Thus when the various forms of the text were being modified, it was important to always attach some urn identifier to every scholion so that the scholia maintained their identity throughout the process.

As for applying the "distant-reading" described by Jocker's, its implementation takes on multiple forms. On the one hand, some of the points made in this thesis were made simply by taking descriptive statistics about the dataset, e.g. how many times does a particular name appear in the main scholia? While this figure would not be impossible to come up with by hand, it is far easier to accomplish with a computer. Particularly since the goal of this thesis is to understand the differences in purpose between the zones of scholia. So knowing that there are the most occurrences of the name Aristarchus could simply be the result of there being the most words in the main scholia. Thus in order to compare the appearances of Aristarchus in the main and itnermarginal scholia, it is necessary to normalize the frequency by dividing the occurrences of a name's appearance in a zone of scholia by the total number of words within that type of scholia. Whereas finding out how many times Aristarchus appears in the main scholia is a feasible, yet annoying statistic on the magnitude of hundreds, finding out how many words are in the main scholia would be practically infeasible on the magnitude of ten thousands. Thus, even fairly simple inquiries require digital technologies when the corpus becomes large enough as in the case of the Venetus A's scholia.

However, not all inquiries can be approached so easily. When trying to determine whether the textual content among the scholia zones is at all similar, there is no simple calculation that one could work through by hand, especially when the corpus becomes so large. In this case, it was necessary to defer to the algorithms developed by others. For this particular inquiry, topic modelling was used extensively in order to highlight in what ways the content of the scholia was quantitatively different. Specifically, I relied on the Latent Dirichlect Allocation (LDA) model of topic modelling. The proof that LDA works and an explanation of its precise mechanism is far too technical and beyond the scope of this thesis. Here, though, I will provide a general outline of how the model works. Then I will discuss some of the issues trying to work with data from topic modelling and my attempts to mitigate these issues.
