Here are located the various tables for data associated with quantifying the length of scholia by the number of words they contain. There are only two tables associated with this line of inquiry. This contains data related to both the third and fourth chapters.

The first table, [scholiaLength.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/scholiaLength.tsv), has five rows (one for the main scholia, one for the interior scholia, etc.), and in each row the table presents how many scholia there are of that type, what the mean length (in words) of scholia within that type, what is the median length (in words) of scholia within that type, and what is the standard deviation of the lengths of scholia within that type.

The second table, [tTestResults.csv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/tTestResults.tsv), contains three columns and presents the results of the analytic T-test which is used to determine whether two datasets are significantly different or not. The first is a label detailing which two zones of the scholia are having their mean length (in words) compared (Main and Intermarginal, e.g.). The second column presents the T-score the T-test creates, and the final column presents whether the two zones being compared have a statisically significant difference or not based on the T-score in the second column. A p<0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
