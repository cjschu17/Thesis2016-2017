The five zones of the Venetus A scholia are patently obvious to any casual onlooker. Beyond their different positioning on the manuscript page, some are written in a different style of handwriting, and the average length of a single scholion differs quite dramatically. An interlinear scholion typically has no more than a few words, while some main scholia take up the entirety of the upper margin. However, it is entirely possible that these differences are coincidental or unimportant. Does it really make a difference that the main scholia and intermarginal scholia differ in handwriting styles? (Hecquet, 79-80) What scholars really want to know is whether the placement of a comment within a particular zone conveys any information, "about the source(s) of the comment" (Ebbott, 1). Could many intermarginal and interior scholia really be just abbreviated versions of main scholia, as Dindorf asserts? (vii) And, perhaps more fundamentally, is there any real difference between the intermarginal and interior scholia or is it better to treat them identically? 

These are the sort of questions digital analyses are better suited to answer than Dindorf's nineteenth-century close readings. The previous chapter was devoted to describing the methods required to prepare a text for digital distant-reading. After a thorough process of text wrangling, the Homeric scholia could now be analyzed with the aid of a computer. It is important to note, in conjunction with the previous discussion of creating different citable versions of the same text, that this text wrangling is not in any way altering the original archival data from the Homer Multitext. Rather, the process of text wrangling creates a different version of the same text. A completely morphologically normalized version of the first main scholion of Book 1 would still be recognizable as the first main scholion of Book 1 and should be cited as such, but it is clearly not the same text. It should be cited as the m-normalized version of that scholion. Thus when the various forms of the text were being modified, it was important to be be congnizant of what version of the scholia I was working.

As for applying the "distant-reading" described by Jocker's, its implementation took multiple forms. On the one hand, some of the points made in this thesis were made simply by taking descriptive statistics of the dataset, e.g. how many times does a particular name appear in the main scholia? While this figure would not be impossible to come up with by hand, it is far easier to accomplish with a computer. Particularly since the goal of this thesis is to understand the differences in purpose between the zones of scholia. So therefore, just knowing that Aristarchus occures most often in the main scholia is actually not that interesting in its own right. That frequency could simply be the result of the main scholia having the most words in general. Thus in order to compare the appearances of Aristarchus in the main and intermarginal scholia, it is necessary to normalize the frequency by dividing the occurrences of a name's appearance in a zone of scholia by the total number of words within that type of scholia. Whereas manually counting how many times Aristarchus appears in the main scholia is a feasible, yet annoying, statistic on the magnitude of hundreds, manually counting how many words are in the main scholia would be practically infeasible on the magnitude of ten thousands. Thus, even fairly simple inquiries require digital technologies when the corpus become ass large as the Venetus A's scholia.

However, not all inquiries can be approached so easily. When trying to determine whether the textual content among the scholia zones is at all similar, there is no simple calculation that one could work through by hand, regardless of corpus size. In this case, it was necessary to defer to the algorithms developed by others. For this particular inquiry, topic modelling was used extensively in order to highlight in what ways the content of the scholia was quantitatively different. Specifically, I relied on the Latent Dirichlect Allocation (LDA) model of topic modelling. 

## Length of Scholia in Words

More about topic modelling, and the problems it poses for replicable and reliable scholarship, will be said when discussing the application of topic modelling to the questions of this thesis. For now, I want to return to the scholia and how forms of simpler implementations of digital technologies can aid in answering certain questions about the scholia. At the most basic level, this thesis is concerned with observing in what way the zones of scholia, particularly the main, intermarginal, and interior zones, are different. So finding fairly basic metrics about the scholia like the average length of a scholion can be useful. For example, the main scholia are, on average, longer than interlinear scholia; this can be seen even without formal analysis. While it is possible that this difference is due largely to the amount of space available in each of these zones, it is more likely that what the scholiast wants to say effects where he will place a comment. The limited space close to the text makes the interlinear space the most appropriate place for those glosses and paraphrases which Dindorf identified as being the main function of the interlinear zone (ix). By contrast, the immensity of space afforded to the main scholia makes in-depth conversations about mythology and history a good fit for that zone.

Where these observations become less clear is in the interior and intermarginal scholia. For all intents and purposes, these two scholia share the same amount of space on the manuscript page, and to the naked eye the individual comments tend to be about equal in length. Here, then, is the advantage of digital technologies. The current data from the Homer Multitext archive includes the completely edited editions of seventeen books from the Venetus A edition of the *Iliad* including all the scholia from each book. The only books missing from this analysis are books 13, 16, and 20-24. Even with an incomplete corpus of scholia, the HMT edition of the scholia includes 148,978 words, which is a sizable enough corpus that my advisor and I felt comfortable asserting that this sample will be representative of the entire corpus of Venetus A scholia. It should be noted that since the scripts which were used to create this data are included in the GitHub repository for my thesis work, any and all of these results should be updated once the entirety of the Venetus A scholia are edited and made available. With all that said, it is time to turn to the data.

![Scholia Zone Length in Words](./images/LengthOfScholInWords.png)

The above chart describes the length of scholia in words, for each of scholia zones. In all these calculations, only the actual comment of the scholia was considered, so the words of the lemma were not included in the various calculations. As discussed above, the main scholia are unsurprisingly the longest scholia, with the average main scholion consisting of 33.78 words, and the interlinear scholia are unsurprisingly the shortest scholia, with the average scholion consisting of 2.31 words. The main and interlinear scholia also sit at the two extremes for the values of standard deviation. The large variance for the main scholia is expected as some main scholia are as short as a few words, while others easily go on for at least one hundred words. Again, this fits the accepted view of the main scholia's function in providing space for expanded discussions of grammar, mythology, etc. as well as more clipped notes. On the other hand, the low standard deviation for the interlinear scholia (1.88), combined with its low mean number of words (2.31) confirms the matches the expectation that the interlinear scholia are mostly used to provide short glosses on words and phrases in the *Iliad* text.

As discussed above, however, confirming that the main and interlinear scholia are definitively different from one another is not necessarily that exciting. What would be of more interest would be a significant difference between the intermarginal and interior scholia. Just based on the descriptive statistics, the two do not appear all that different. Both have an average length of about 7 words, though the interior are a bit longer on average (7.66 words on average for the interior versus 7.1 words for the intermarginal). However, the standard deviation for the two throws uncertainty over the significance of this slight difference. With a standard deviation of 5.74 words for the interior and 3.97 words for the intermarginal, the two sets of scholia definitely overlap in their average lengths. Since it is not apparent from just looking at the descriptive statistics if there is any difference between these two groups, inferential statistics are required in order to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the average length of the intermarginal scholia and the average length of the interior scholia.

![T-Test Comparing Average Lengths of Scholia Zones](./images/lengthTTEst1.png)

The above table is the result of a Welch's t-Test, which is able to compare two samples of data in order to conclude if the difference in their means are statistically significant. Since there are so many scholia in each zone (even the exterior scholia, the zone with the fewest scholia, still has 233 scholia), it was assumed that there were essentially infinite degrees of freedom when conducting these tests. In order to achieve significance with a p-value less than 0.05, an idividual test needs a T-score of at least 1.96. Unsurprisingly, given the previous discussion, the difference between the main and interlinear scholia was extremely significant, with a t-score of 60.61. In fact, all the t-tests where the main scholia were one of the sets of data were extremely statistically significant. This only reaffirms the idea that the main scholia are home to a particular set of scholia that are not found in the other zones of scholia.

To return to the intermarginal and interior scholia, a t-Test found there to be a statistically significant difference between the two's mean length as well. Thus, even without knowing anything about what the scholia actually say, one can confidently assert that there is a difference between the intermarginal and interior scholia. The difference may be slight, but it exists. At the very least, this difference suggests that there was a systematic way of placing scholia in the interior zone over the intermarginal zone and vice versa. There seem to be a few plausible explanations for this. On the one hand, the scholiast could be working with a single source which supplies all of the scholia for the interior and intermarginal scholia. However, the scholiast reserves the interior zone for only certain types of comments from the single source, while the intermarginal zone is reserved for other types of comments. Alternatively, the two zones of the scholia could be composed of comments arising from the same source, but one zone, the intermarginal for example, is filled up first before the scholiast moves to the interior scholia. Finally, it is simply possible that the two different zones are composed from different sources. This multi-source theory is, perhaps, the simplest explanation in terms of trying to assess why the distribution of the scholia in the intermarginal and interior zones are so disparate, where there are roughly 1200 intermarginal scholia but only about 800 interior scholia. However, it is difficult with the evidence provided so far to conclude that the intermarginal and interior scholia were composed from different sources. Thus, the most one can say at this point is that there was some system to placing scholia into one zone, either the intermarginal or interior scholia, over the other. By contrast, if the two came from comments contained in a single source which were then randomly assigned to the two zones, there should not be 401 more intermarginal scholia than interior scholia - the two zones would have a more equal distribution were they randomly assigned to a zone and there should not be a significant difference in their lengths.

As for the rest of t-tests, it is unsurprising that most of them demonstrate that there are statistically significant differences between the types of scholia. Only two of the tests could not demonstrate that the types of scholia were significantly different. However, both of the instances involved the exterior scholia, a particularly confusing zone of scholia. As the descriptive statistics demonstrate, the median length of an exterior scholion is one, but its mean is 4.19 and its standard deviation 28.56. This suggests that there are a few exterior scholia which are extremely wordy, and that these outliers are skewing the data. In fact, the median relates that at least half of the exterior scholia are comprised of just a single word which conforms to Allen's hypothesis that this zone consisted of the editorial of a secondary scribe (172). However, there is one exterior on folio 154v that is composed of 436 words and such an extreme outlier is without a doubt skewing the data. So after removing this single scholia from the dataset, I re-ran the t-tests and came up with the results below.  As predicted, the removal of the outlier scholion resulted in the difference between intermarginal and exterior to become statistically significant. Thus, there should be no doubt that these two zones of scholia contains different types of comments. 


![Revised T-test for Length of Scholia Zones](./images/lengthTTest2.png)

As for the interlinear and exterior scholia, this particular test was unable to show them as being any different, and this should not be particularly troubling. Both zones of scholia mostly contain comments that consist of a single word. 82.24% of the interlinear scholia are 3 or fewer words, while a similar 84.55% of exterior scholia are 3 or fewer words. But as before, I am deferring to the work of Dindorf and Allen to explain the function of the interlinear and exterior zones, respectively.

## Appearances of Lemmata

Before further linguistic tests, there is one more facet of the scholia that can be investigated without having to really read a single scholion. As stated previously, the HMT edition of the Venetus A scholia breaks a scholion into three distinct portions which is reflected in three separate `<div>` elements per scholion. One of the `<div>` elements is the comment of the scholion, the second is a URN for the line of the *Iliad* which the scholion is commenting on. The final division and element of a scholion is its lemma. Again, this "lemma" is different from the meaning of "lemma" from chapter 2. In chapter 2, "lemma" referred to the form of a word one would use to look it up in a dictionary. In terms of the structure of the Venetus A, a "lemma" is a quotation from the line which is being commented on and is included at the beginning of a scholion. Thus the lemma acts as a footnote of sorts linking a scholion with the *Iliad*. In Myriam Hecquet's discussion of the paleography of the Venetus A, she describes that the lemmata of the main scholia are written in a distinct style of handwriting, but does mention that lemmata appear in any other type of scholia (Hecquet, 79-80). Thus it is worth investigating if Hecquet's implicit conclusion has any weight to it. In other words, do zones of scholia besides the main scholia have lemmata, and if so how many? Although lemmata are only expected in the main scholia, every zone of the scholia is edited by the HMT such that if a lemma should appear it will be treated as such. Otherwise, the lemma portion of the scholion is just left blank. Thus I could simply search the lemmata for each of the zones of scholia and see how many of those scholia actually had content in them. The results are shown below:

![Number of Lemmata per Zone](./images/lemmata.png)

Unsurprisingly, the main scholia are the zone of scholia which have the most lemmata. Though such a conclusion is a bit understatement. More accurately, seeing a lemma in any of the scholia that are not the main scholia is downright rare. In the case of the interlinear scholia, there are no lemmata at all. Since there were so few lemmata on non-main scholia, it was rather simple to look into those instances where these lemmata appeared. In two instances (urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msAim.hmt:11.4 and urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msAim.hmt:17.17) the two intermarginal scholia appeared outside of the space typically associated with that particular zone. Intermarginal scholia usually appear in the vertical margin between the *Iliad* text and the main scholia. However the former scholion appears in the upper horizontal margin above the *Iliad* text and below the main scholia and the latter scholion appears in the lower horizontal margin below the *Iliad* text and above the main scholia. Further research would have to be done on intermarginal scholia that appear in these two margins, but it seems fair to say that their position makes them odd already. Beyond this, there is little that one can say definitively about the presence of lemmata in non-main scholia given this limited dataset. 9 out of the 11 non-main scholia with lemmata appear on pages that are extremely packed with comments in the main scholia. Thus, it is tempting to conclude that these scholia with lemmata are simply cases where the scholiast ran out of room in the main scholia zone and thus decided to record the scholia somewhere else. However, if this were true, it should also be true that whenever a manuscript page is full with main scholia, there should be some non-main scholia with lemmata. While a formal investigation into this matter has not been conducted, anecdotal evidence can substitute well enough. There are countless folios of the Venetus A which are completely filled to the brim with scholia, yet still contain no lemmata outside the main scholia. The first page of the *Iliad* text, folio 12r, serves as a prime example of this point since the nearly every margin of the page is completely filled yet there is not a single lemmata beyond the main scholia. In other words, while a formal analysis would be preferred, previous experience with the Venetus A has taught me that if there were supposed to be some link between pages with full main scholia zones and lemmata in the non-main scholia, there should be way more than 11 lemmata in the main scholia.

To add to this argument that these non-main scholia with lemmata are not simply main scholia located in a non-main zone, none of the lemmata observed in the non-main zone are written in that same semi-uncial handwriting which Hecquet noted is a strong characteristic of the main scholia (Hecquet, 79). If there is any common thread among some of the scholia observed in non-main scholia, it is that four of five the lemmata seen in the interior scholia occur within a span of 26 lines from Book 2.194-219. Beyond a suggestion that at one time a source for commentary on Book 2 that included lemmata was used to create the interior scholia in Book 2, there is little else to say. 

Ultimately, these observations confirm expectations about the purpose of the lemmata in the Venetus A. An overwhelming majority of main scholia (95%) use lemmata, most likely since their distance from the text on the page requires some method of aligning scholion to *Iliad* line. By contrast, intermarginal, interior, and interlinear can all be placed as close to the *Iliad* line as possible, both because of the positioning of their "zone" on the manuscript page, but also because the average scholion is much shorter than that of the main scholia. Thus it is easier to pack them closer together near the lines. In the case of the interlinear scholia, their comments are so short, it easy for the scribe to place the comment directly above the word of interest. As for the exterior scholia, it clear that the proximity argument does not work. However, given the relative sparsity of exterior scholia (233 in this sample of the manuscript) and, generally, their brevity (a median of 1 word) it is easy for the scholiasts to align their exterior scholion content so that it is on the same horizontal plane as the line it is commenting on. Thus, in all four cases, lemmata are not necessary for their function, thus it is unsurprising that they show up so few times, if at all.

## Scribal Voice vs. Non-Scribal Voice

After I completed these more general forms of analysis, I began to analyze the actual text of the scholia. One of the first analyses I conducted was a look into the kinds of discourse present in the different zones of the scholia. By "discourse" I mean whether the scribe is writing words which seem to be coming straight from his own mind, or whether any of the words are able to be attributed to the voice of anyone besides the scribe. As for an example of the former, scribal voice, the main scholion to first line of the *Iliad* wonders why the poems begins as it does. It reads, "They question why [the poet] started in this way from the wrath [and] from the ill-omened name (ζητοῦσι δια τί ἀπὸ τῆς μήνιδος ἤρξατο οὕτως δυσφήμου ὀνόματος, urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.hmt:1.1.comment). While the scribe of the Venetus A may be simply copying this sentence from a previous scholiast, there is no indication given that this sentence comes from any other source than the scribe himself. Thus it is considered an example of scribal voice. By contrast, non-scribal voice are words that are obviously derived from a source other than the scribe's own mind. These include quotations from the *Iliad*, Greek tragedy, other ancient scholars, etc. Any time the text can be definitively attributed to a different source, it is an example of non-scribal voice. Regardless of the specific type of non-scribal voice, all words written in the non-scribal voice are marked up in the Homer Multitext's edition with the TEI element `<q>`. Thus, it is rather simple to identify what words are written in the scribe's voice or not. Below is the distribution of scribal and non-scribal voice by zone of scholia. It should be noted that scholia from Book 3 and 6 were excluded from this analysis since these two books were edited at a time in the HMT which did same editorial standards as those today.

![Discourse Measurements by Scholia Zone](./images/discource1.png)

There are number of things to say about the data above, but what is most clear is that scribal voice is definitely more pervasive than non-scribal voice for each of the types of scholia. This is especially true of the interlinear scholia, 99% of whose words are written in scribal voice. Again, this is consistent with the common usage of the interlinear scholia to provide a gloss on the *Iliad* text. According to HMT editorial conventions, these interlinear glosses are considered "scribal voice," thus the high percentage of scribal voice is not surprising.

What is perhaps surprising is the similarity in the distribution of scribal and non-scribal voice among the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia. As mentioned previously, prior scholarship has furthered some theories about the relationship between these three zones of the scholia, including the idea that many intermarginal and interior scholia are summaries of longer main scholia. Here, however, it appears there is a definitive difference between the distribution of scribal and non-scribal voice between the intermarginal scholia and the other two zones. In fact, running a Z-score test for proportions revealed that the intermarginal scholia had a significantly different distribution of the two types of voice from both the main and interior scholia. In order for a difference to be statistically different, the probability of the two datasets being the same needs to be less than 5%, which occurs when there is a Z-score greater than 1.96. The data is displayed in the table below.

![Z-test for Proportions on Scribal and Non-Scribal Voice](./images/discourseZTest1.png)

While this particularl dataset shows that the distribution of scribal and non-scribal voice to be essentially the same for the main and interior scholia, one should not conclude that these two zones have identical content. This dataset says nothing definitive about the content of scholia, just the systematic use of language in the two zones.

Furthermore, it is worth looking into the further classification of non-scribal voice into two distinct categories: quoted text and quoted language. Quoted text refers to words that can be directly attributed to a text outside of the *Iliad* line the scholion is commenting on. So if a scholion is quoting a passage from the *Odyssey*, from Greek tragedy, or a passage from a different book of the *Iliad*, that quote is considered quoted text. Quoted language, on the other hand, refers to words that either exist in the *Iliad* line that the scholion is commenting on, or instances where the scholiast is using a word to refer to the word in its abstract form. Very often this abstract use of language usage occurs when the scholiast is discussing the morphology or etymology of a word. For example, a main scholion to line 182 of book 18 of the *Iliad* reads, "Just as "τίθεσθαι" is the infinitive form associated with "τίθενται", in this way "δίεσθαι" is the infinitive form associated with "δίενται" (ὥσπερ οὖν παρα τὸ τίθενται ἐστιν  ἀπαρέμφατον τίθεσθαι· οὕτως καὶ παρα τὸ δίενται τὸ δίεσθαι, urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.hmt:18.62). Translating the scholion into English helps to make clear what sorts of words are examples of language usage, since legitimate language usage words should not be translated. The scribe is using the word to refer to the word in the abstract, not to get at what the word means. 

While both types of non-scribal voice are set apart by the TEI element for a quote `<q>`, quoted text has additional mark-up to allow for a URN citation of where the quote is coming from. Given these mark-up conventions, the table below details the distribution of the two types of non-scribal voice by each zone of the scholia. 

![Non-Scribal Voice Measurements by Zone](./images/discourse2.png)

The most striking detail of the above table is how the main scholia are the only zone of the scholia to utilize quoted text to any meaningful degree, with 53% of the words in the non-scribal voice relating being a quoted text word. By contrast, quoted text comprises only about 7% to 9% of the non-scribal voice words for intermarginal, interior, and interlinear scholia, and none of the non-scribal voice for the exterior scholia. When a Z-score test for proportions was run on this dataset, all of the non-main scholia were combined into a single data point, and this is represented in table above with the row labeled "Non-Main". Comparing distribution of quoted text and quoted language words between the main and non-main scholia resulted in a Z-score of 36.75. To repeat, in order to achieve be a statistically significant difference, the Z-score must be above 1.96, which corresponds to there being a less than 5% chance that the two datasets are the same. A Z-score of 36.75 corresponds with there being a less than 0.001% chance of the two datasets being identical. Thus, it can be stated with great confidence that the distribution of words within non-scribal voice differs significantly between the main scholia and the non-main scholia.

Practically, this difference suggests that quoting a text beyond the line of the *Iliad* being commented on is something with much more frequency with the main scholia than any other zone of the scholia. It was already shown by comparing the distribution of scribal and non-scribal voice that the main and intermarginal scholia differ significantly in their use of language, and this dataset only strengthens this conclusion as the two zones are again shown to use language differently, with quoted text comprising a far greater percentage of words in non-scribal voice. However, the distribution of scribal and non-scribal voice did not show any significant difference main and interior scholia. This might lead someone to conclude that these two zones are fairly closely related since if the use language in similar ways, they might derive from the same, or at least, similar source. However, the distribution of words in non-scribal voice dispels any such conclusions. The interior zone's distribution of quoted text and language differed as significantly from the main scholia as the intermarginal scholia did. 

In fact, a Z-score test for proportions found no significant difference in the distribution of quoted text and quoted language between interior and intermarginal scholia (Z-score: 0.79). This detail complicates the relationship between the intermarginal and interior as, according to this metric, the two appear to come from a similar source, or at least from sources which have identical distributions of quoted text and quoted language. However, one cannot case aside the observation that the intermarginal and interior scholia have a statistically significant difference in the distribution of words in scribal and non-scribal voice. The firmest conclusion that can be made is that the intermarginal and interior scholia's difference in distribution of scribal and non-scribal voice, though similar in terms of its distribution of quoted text and language, ensure that the two zones of the scholia cannot be treated identically, and the difference is most likely reflective of their coming from separate sources.

In sum, he different types of discourse employed in the five scholia zones, particularly the differences observed among the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia, further the argument begun by their differences in length of scholia in words, that the five zones should be treated as five distinct zones. There has been no strong evidence thus far to suggest that treating the scholia zones as anything other than separate texts is a valid way of approaching the Venetus A. However, it should be conceded that neither length of scholia no type of discourse says anything about the content of the scholia. It is entirely possible that the zones of the scholia talk about the exact same content, but are merely presented in different types of language that are reflected in the difference in discourse across the five zones. What is required is some way to study systematically the content of the five zones of the scholia.

One rather simple method for assessing content is to look at what names appear most frequently in each of the five zones of the scholia. Named entities can give a deal of insight into the content and purpose of various scholia. If a scholion abounds in in characters from characters from the *Iliad*, for example this might mean that the scholia is explaining a particular plot point, mythology, or is dealing with quotes from the text. On the other hand, if a scholion is full of famous ancient grammarians, the reader can guess that grammar is that sholion's focus. To start off this analysis, the table below presents total number instances of a name appearing compared to the total number of words in each scholia zone.


![Ratio of Names to All Word per Scholia Zone](./images/names.png)

This beginning analysis is, again, more focused on the language and composition of the various zones than interested in the content, per se. Were a particular zone to have a very large proportion of personal names, one would assume that it served a fundamentally different purpose than one which contained nearly no personal names. This dataset contains no such clear cut difference when looking at the proportions. Particularly, among the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia there is a difference of, at most 1.5%. A Z-test for proportions, however, reveals that the difference among all three zones is indeed significant.

![Z-test for Proportions on Ratio of Names to Words per Scholia Zone](./images/namesZScore.png)

Although there is a statistically significant difference, it is worth noting that this difference, which is only 0.64% between the main and interior zone, may not practically significant, in isolation. However, within the content of the rest of the data presented up to this point, it acts as further support for the argument that these three zones differ in fundamental compositional aspects and should not be treated as coming from the same source.

However, as mentioned, the focus has shifted away from compositional aspects and towards content. Additionally, from here on out, data will often be provided on the interlinear and exterior scholia, but the main, intermarginal, interior zones will be the primary focus of any analyses. This is because even a cursory reading of the manuscript will show that these three zones, provide the commentary on the *Iliad*. Interlinear and exterior scholia are usually no more than a word or two in length, and thus, by nature of their extreme brevity cannot provide commentary comparable to the other three zones.  

Full histograms of the most commonly appearing for the [main](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Data/NameData/HistogramsOfScholiaTypes/mainScholiaHistogram.tsv), [intermarginal](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Data/NameData/HistogramsOfScholiaTypes/imScholiaHistogram.tsv), and [interior](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Data/NameData/HistogramsOfScholiaTypes/intScholiaHistogram.tsv) scholia are available in my thesis github page. In all three zones, the Alexandrian editor Aristarchus is the most frequently occurring name and in all three zones Zenodotus comes in as the second most frequent. After this initial unity, however, the three begin to diverge considerably. In the main scholia, there are 19 names which comprise at least 1% of the total name appearances in the main scholia. By contrast, there are only 6 names in the intermarginal scholia which appear with a frequency of at least 1% and only 10 in the interior scholia. And of all those names which occur with a frequency of at least 1%, the three Alexandrian editors, Aristarchus, Zenodotus, and Aristophanes, and the ancient grammarian Herodian are the only names common to all three zones of scholia. Herodian was mentioned in chapter 1 as one of the four sources explicitly referenced in the subscription as being a primary source for the scholia. Thus, without reservation, a conclusion can be drawn that the work of the Alexandrian editors is a topic that is talked about with a great deal of regularity in all three zones of scholia. So too is the work of Herodian. The presence of the Alexandrian editors' names is not particularly striking since the subscription reports that the scholia are the result of scholars who came after the Alexandrians and thus would be making reference to the Alexandrians in their own commentaries. 

Herodian's appearance is a bit surprising. Presumably Herodian did not write his work on prosody by referencing himself in the third person. So if certain scholia are excerpts from his work, one might expect Herodian's name to show up very rarely, if at all. This logic is corroborated by the fact that the other three names from the subscription, Aristonicus, Nicanor, and Didymus are not mentioned with any frequency whatsoever in the main and interior scholia, and are never mentioned in the intermarginal scholia. Thus it appears that much of the work about Herodian seems to have been passed down by some later source who is citing Herodian, rather than being presented in scribal voice like the other three authors mentioned in the subscription. This is not to say that Herodian's text is never present in the scholia in scribal voice, but that an non-scribal voice presentation of his material occurs far more commonly than the material in the subscription.

In order to find out how the various zones are different, however, one has to look at the differences in the sets of names. Aside from the three Alexandrian editors and Herodian, there are only two other names which appear in the intermarginal scholia with a frequency over 1%. One is Homer and the other Agamemnon. In the interior scholia, there are no other non-mythological names to appear with relative frequency outside of the Alexandrian editors and Herodian. Achilles, Zeus, Menelaus, Hector, Odysseus, Patroclus, and Priam round out the interior scholion. 

Here, though, one must be careful not to view this difference between the mythological names mentioned in the interior and intermarginal as meaningful. The differences seen thus far are the result of only looking for names which occurred with a frequency which was arbitrarily set by myself. When I decided to look beyond the arbitrary level of frequency and just look at all the names which appear more than once, the differences between the two zones start to fade. There were no names which appeared in the interior scholia that did not also appear in the intermarginal. One the other hand, there were six names that appeared in the intermarginal scholia that did not appear in the interior. However, of these six, Diomedes is the only name to appear more than twice, and the other five (Clio, Apollo, Ixion, Thetis, and Alcimedon) are all mythological figures or characters from the Iliad. Thus there is not a strong suggestion that the distribution of names between the intermarginal and interior scholia is of much significance.

The main scholia, however, do differ significantly from the interior and intermarginal scholia. There are 107 names which appear at least four times in the main scholia and which appear in no other zone. While many of these exclusively main names are also characters from the *Iliad*, there are some significant historical and grammatical figures that appear only in the main scholia. Most prominent is the appearance is Ptolemy of Ascalon, a post-Aristarchean Homeric scholar who appears 46 times in the main scholia, but never in the intermarginal or interior scholia. The full list of names found in the main but not elsewhere is located [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Data/NameData/Difference/meaningfulMainExclusiveWithCountOver3.tsv), and it includes the poets Euripides, Aeschylus, Callimachus, and Pindar, the historian Thucydides, and post-Alexandrian Homeric scholars like Crates of Mallus and Porphyry. 

On the one hand, the breadth of names exclusive to the main scholia should not be too surprising given what was already observed about the much higher frequency of quoted text in the main scholia than intermarginal and interior scholia. However, when that observation was made, the observation had to stop at the level of analyzing the language of the scholia and no conclusions could be made about the content of the scholia. Now, with the names known, more can be said about the difference between the main scholia and the other two zones. Quoted text includes both quotes from sources outside the *Iliad* as well as quotes from passages of the *Iliad* besides the line immediately being commented on by the scholia. Since sources from the outside the *Iliad* are appearing almost exclusively in the main scholia, it is a fair assumption that many of these quoted text words among the main scholia are quotes from outside of the *Iliad*. By contrast, quotes from outside the *Iliad*, or at least from outside of Homeric epic must appear very rarely in the intermarginal and interior scholia. This analysis does not prevent Homeric epic quotes from appearing in the main scholia, it merely suggests that quotes outside of the Homeric epics will rarely ever be found outside of the main scholia. This represents the first truly noteworthy difference in content between the various zones of the scholia, and sets the main scholia apart as coming from a source or various sources that include quotes from outside of the Homeric epics.

Other analyses could be done with the personal name data, but for now this chapter will move towards another way to analyze systematically the content between multiple zones: topic modeling. The mathematical proof that LDA works and an explanation of its precise mechanism is far too technical and beyond the scope of this thesis. Here, though, I will provide a general outline of how the model works. Then I will discuss some of the issues trying to work with data from topic modelling and my attempts to mitigate these issues.

The basic assumption behind topic modelling is that any and all texts vary to some degree in their content. Whether a text be a novel, or whether it be a group of historical documents, a text varies in its contents. If there were no variation, it would not be a text but a single word repeated over and over again. So, in a simple example, a work like the *Iliad* contains descriptive passages ranging from a duel, a chariot race, lamentation, arming for battle, insulting, and so on. While such changes in scene are obvious to someone with some reading comprehension skills, it is hard to quantify exactly what makes these various scenes different. Thus topic modelling aims at using digital technologies to identify the different topics which end up contributing to the entirety of the text. So in following with the above example, one running a topic model on sections of the Iliad might expect to find a topic devoted to the language of prayer and another topic devoted to the language of battle. A "topic" is more than just a general label for a section of a text, but practically in topic modelling it refers to a set of vocabulary items that the computer has recognized as frequently occurring together in particular order again and again. In reality, topic modelling assumes that a text is written in a peculiar fashion. The model assumes that an author has at their disposal a number of different "topics," which is just a set of vocabulary, and that the author draws from these various topics in order to compose the final text. Thus, the goal of topic modelling is to uncover these specific "topics." 

This model is designed to overcome the fact that computers do not read like humans. To cite a popular example, the two phrases "time flies like an arrow" and "fruit flies like an apple" would seem nearly identical to a computer which can only recognize if the characters which make up words are equivalent. Thus by treating a potential corpus as just a seemingly random assembly of words, topic modelling is able to identify the reoccurring patterns of co-occurring words which define topics. To reiterate from the previous chapter's discussion of text wrangling, it should be clear now why having a clean corpus of text is necessary for topic modelling. If the modelling relies on the co-occurrence of words, then it is important that the variants forms of a word be reduced into a simplified lemma. Otherwise important linguistic co-occurrences might be left out of the analysis.

Before progressing further in this discussion of topic modelling a final point should be made about the nature of "topics." As stated previously, topics are a set of vocabulary items that an algorithm has identified as constituting a recurring pattern of co-occurring terms. As such, "topics" in their most basic sense, do not have to confer information about subject matter. In some cases, topic modelling can be used to identify differences in an author's style. Thus the "topics" would not be collections of words relating to a particular subject, but rather a collection of words that might give information about a particular author's style.

As discussed in the previous chapter, running a topic model on an ancient Greek text requires a good deal of text wrangling. Not only do the scholia need to normalized in order to create a lemmatized version of the text, topic modeling requires a corpus in which the most common words are eliminated from the corpus. Considering the aims of topic modelling, this makes a good deal of sense. Topics are, again, repeating patterns of co-occurring words, so if there are very common words in the dataset, they will occur over and over again in various places, perhaps creating the impression that phrases that have nothing to do with one another are actually related to one another. The two phrases "Poe and Frost" and "manatee and walrus" very obviously are referring to American poets and sea mammals, respectively, to a computer the presence of "and" in both phrases might create an impression that the two phrases are actually related and should be included in the same topic. It is to avoid confusion like this that creating a list of stop-words to be deleted from a text is necessary for topic modelling. For this dataset, the list of stop-words can be found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Data/TopicModelData/stopWords.txt).

While there are a number of programs which allow for LDA topic modelling, I used ToPan, a topic modelling software designed by Thomas Köntges. One of the hardest parts about running a topic model is that one has to tell the program how many topics to create. In other words, LDA topic modelling does not analyze a text and then spit back a text broken into some optimal number of topics. Again, the computer cannot understand meaning, it only looks for repeating patterns of co-occurring words, and the computer can find as many patterns as one tells it to. Thus there is some human work required to determine what the optimal number of topics is. Depending on the size and nature of the corpus, the optimal number of topics can range from five topic to twenty-five.

In ToPan, the results of a topic are displayed in a visualization like the one seen below:

![15-Topic Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjschu17/drdwPortfolio/master/images/ToPanViz12-6-16/Topic4.png)

In this visualization, each of the circles represents a different topic, and when a topic is highlighted, the words which are most strongly associated with the topic are listed on the right. So in this particular topic, words like διασταλτέον (must be stopped short), βραχύς (short), λόγος (word) στικτέον (must be punctuated), ἑξῆς (order of the sentence), στίχος (line), σύνδεσμος (conjunction), τέλειος (ending), συναπτέον (must be joined), and στίζω (punctuate) make it clear that this topic has something with syntax and punctuation. It is a clear grammar topic. Other topics had words that clearly related to battles, the gods, and even the Alexandrian editors.

In order to determine what number of topics will produce a good topic model, every one of the topics needs to be analyzed in order to determine an optimal balance between topics which can be clearly interpreted and topics which cannot be so easily interpreted. After running a number of trials, fifteen topics seemed to produce the clearest results, and it has become the default number of topics for running a topic model on the scholia.

Topic modelling, by its nature, is a random process. Thus using a single result from topic modelling presents issues for reproducibility by other scholars. For example, if I were to observe a particularly interesting when running a topic model, someone else could theoretically run their own topic model and never come across a similar topic. Is my finding still significant or has it now become insignificant in light of the other person's topic model. The obvious work-around my collaborator and advisor devised was to run a number of topic models on the same dataset and observe if topics remain similar from run to run. So, if ten topic models are run on the scholia and nine of them contain a topic about punctuation, one could safely say that punctuation words constitute a significant topic within the scholia.

Currently, the topic modelling software being used, ToPan, does not seem to offer the option to create different results when the exact same setting are used. The only way, it appears, to get different results is to change the number of iterations within a run of the topic model. This is not ideal for the sake of reproducibility, wherein it would be much better if the same test could be run again and again under the exact same conditions. Despite this, there are three different topic models which have been run which help to give a sense of what are the dominant topics present in the scholia.

The first topic model was run on data was far less clean than the other two topic models. The scholia in this topic model were neither p-normalized, o-normalized, nor effectively m-normalized. In the first two cases, the scripts for p and o-normalization did not yet exist. An m-normalizing script did exist at the time, but in this older version a single word which could be from two different words would be converted into two separate words, such as the Greek word τίς being converted its two possible m-normalized forms, τις and τίς. In the new m-normalizing script, multiple parses of a single word are combined into a single character string separated by an "x". So τίς is m-normalized to τιςxτίς. This concatenation helps to avoid significant cluttering of the data. 

Still, despite this original topic model being created without a p-normalized, o-normalized, or effectively m-normalized corpus, topics which could be meaningfully identified were apparent. Of its fifteen topics, there were two topics which related directly to grammatical vocabulary, one devoted to words related to accentuation and another devoted to words punctuation. There were two topics dealing with the work of the Alexandrian editors, one seeming to focus on talking about Aristarchus, and one seeming to focus on talking about Zenodotus and Aristophanes over Aristarchus. Beyond this, there was a topic about gods and the language of family, suggesting a genealogy topic. Since the scholia quote the Iliad at length, Iliadic vocabulary is present to a great deal in these topic models, and there are topics dealing with the language of battle. However, many of these topics were definitely affected by the lack of normalization. The clearest example is seen below:

![Unnormalized Topic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjschu17/drdwPortfolio/master/images/ToPanViz12-6-16/Topic13.png)

 Among this topic's strongly associated words are βοῦς βοάω βοή βόα and βόειος which translate, respectively into: cow, shout (verb), shout (noun), fish, and cow-like. Clearly there is no connection among the meaning of the words, and their similarity in form reveals that they are only associated with one another since the commonly occurring form βοή can be m-normalized into any of the above five forms. Thus the lack of concatenation is making the topic modelling software observe patterns that do not actually exist.
 
 Thus the other two topic models were run on cleaner data, using a p-, o-, and m-normalized corpus. The first of the two topic models was run at 2000 iterations while the second topic model was run at 5000 iterations. It is worth noting that the two topic models were not only similar to each other, but similar in many ways to the first topic model ran on the much less clean data. This suggests that the topics which are common to all three topic models are undoubtedly significant topics within the scholia.
 
These definitive topics common to all three topic models include the two grammar topics, one for punctuation and one for accentuation, as well as the two editor's topics, one for talking about Aristarchus and one for talking about the two Alexandrian editors other than Aristarchus. The gods and genealogy topic also occurs in all three topic models. 

When considering just the two topic models run on the clean data, the similarity between the two runs is striking. Twelve of the fifteen topics were shared by the two topic models. This significant overlap suggests that the results from the topic model can be trusted as giving an accurate reflection of the content within all the scholia. 

While it is certainly significant that using a topic model to analyze the content of the scholia works, a successful topic model is not an end in itself. ToPan provides data such that one can examine the relationship between scholia and topics in two ways. For example, one can analyze the relationship with respect to scholia, meaning that for each scholion, which topics are contributing the most to its content. However, I chose to analyze the relationship with respect to topic, meaning that for each topic which scholia are most strongly associated with it.  

In order to conduct such analysis, I made use of the data-tables created by ToPan. The original data table for the first run on clean data is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/master/Data/TopicModelData/theta.csv). However, a sample table is shown below:

![Sample theta table](./images/SampleToPanTable.png)

Each row of the table corresponds to a single scholion, and each row is comprised of 18 columns. The first three columns contain identifiers for the scholion, though in this sample table I have eliminated the first column leaving only the Urn identifier and the text of the scholion. The other 15 columns contains a theta-scores for each of the 15 topics, though here I reduced 15 columns just to two. A theta-score is a measurement of associative strength. Were a scholion to score a 0.0 in a particular topic, this would indicate that this particular scholion contains no content from that particular topic. Conversely, a score of 1.0 would indicate that the content of this scholion would likely come *only* from this topic. Since a topic model by definition classifies all the patterns of language into defined number of topics, the sum of all the theta-scores in a single row has to equal 1.0, since the content of a scholion cannot come from anywhere else but the defined topics.

Using this table, I was able to identify which scholia had the strongest associations with each of the topics. I defined a "strong association" as a scholion having a theta-score equal to or greater than 0.9. Thus I made fifteen tables, one for each topic, which simply consisted of a list of every scholion hose theta-score was equal to or greater than 0.9 for that topic. These tables can be found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Data/TopicModelData/ThetaTables-3-15-2017). 

Now that the scholia which are most strongly associated with each topic had been assembled, it was now possible to analyze the distribution of content by zone of the scholia. For each of the tables just created, it was determined how many came from the main, interior, intermarginal, interlinear, and exterior. If the distribution of the zones within each topic should match the distribution of scholia across the entire Venetus A, an argument could be made that the five zones do not differ in their content. A full list of the distribution of each zone among the scholia with the strongest associations is located [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Data/TopicModelData/newToPanResult.txt). As a reference, below is a table displaying the frequency of each type of scholia across 18 books of the Venetus A:

![Frequency of Scholia Zones in Venetus A](./images/frequencyOfSchol.png)

While I will not examine all of the topics individually, there are a few things which can be said in general about the distribution of the topics by zone. For example, none of the topics' distributions comes close to resembling the distribution of scholia across the Venetus A. This primarily due to the fact that, while interlinear scholia constitute 26% of the scholia in the Venetus A, their extremely short length, rarely longer than two words, makes it hard for any topic to appear with any sort of frequency in this zone. This is also probably happening in the case of exterior scholia, since they also rarely contain more than two words. Thus it may make more sense to present with relative frequency of main, intermarginal, and interior scholia, separate from the interlinear and exterior scholia. Given these criteria, a new distribution of strongly associated scholia by topic was created and it can be found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Data/TopicModelData/noIlExtToPanResult.txt). The table below provides the new reference point for comparing just main, intermarginal, and interior zones of the scholia:

![Revised Frequency of Scholia Zones in Venetus A](./images/adjustedFreqOfSchol.png)

Re-evaluating the data, there are still a number of noteworthy features. For example, of the fifteen topics, ten have a distribution that mirrors the distribution of scholia zones across the manuscript. In other words, in these ten topics, main constitute the greatest proportion of the scholia for that topic, intermarginal constitute the second highest proportion, and interior constitute the lowest. However, the exact proportions differ widely among the various topics. Furthermore, fourteen of the fifteen topics listed the main scholia as constituting the greatest proportion of the most strongly associated scholia, regardless of the interior and intermarginal scholia. For example, topic 1, a topic comprised of words for accentuation, is made up of 84.3% main scholia, a significantly higher percentage than the main's 63.8% prevalence across the whole Venetus A. Conversely, topic 15, a topic comprised of words that seem to have some connection to human emotions, is comprised of only 43.55% main scholia. However, in both cases, the main still appear with the most frequency within their respective topics. In light of this, it is fair to say that, generally, the various topics seem to mirror the distribution of scholia across the manuscript, suggesting that, in general, content is not zone specific. Rather, many of these topics appear in the zones at the same rate at which the zones appear at all.

Topic 6, shown below, best mirrors the expected distribution of scholia zones. Topic 6 is a topic focused on talking about the work of two of the Alexandrian scholars, Zenodotus and Aristophanes, and not the third of the Alexandrians, Aristarchus.

**Topic 6**

![Frequency of scholia zones within Topic 6](./images/Topic6.png)

Given this observation, the data seems to argue that the language which talks about Zenodotus and Aristophanes separate from Aristarchus is language that is used evenly across the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia. In other words, this particular topic is not zone-specific.

However, the lack of zone-specific content is not absolute. It is worth examining the one example where a zone other than the main scholia constitutes the largest proportion of the most strongly associated scholia. This occurs in topic 9, a topic which is almost the opposite of the previously discussed topic 6. Whereas topic 6 dealt with language discussing Zenodotus and Aristophanes separate from Aristarchus, topic 9 deals with language that discusses all three, but places a particular emphasis on discussing Aristarchus. Below is the proportion of each zone among the most strongly associated scholia within topic 9.

**Topic 9**

![Frequency of scholia zones within Topic 9](./images/Topic9.png)

What is noticeable about the above table is that not only do the intermarginal scholia constitute so much greater a proportion of scholia within this topic than the main scholia, but also that their proportion is over two times that of the proportion of intermarginal scholia throughout the manuscript (intermarginal scholia constitute 47.1% of scholia within topic 9 but just 21.6% of the total scholia in the Venetus A). Clearly, the zone distribution for topic 9 goes against the typical zone distribution seen across the manuscript which was mirrored by the distribution of zones within topic 6. This suggests that, unlike topic 6, the language of topic 9 *is* zone-specific. Specifically, this "Aristarchus" topic seems to have a disproportionate concentration within the intermarginal scholia.

This is a point which requires a more thorough explanation in order to fully understand its import. The disproportionate concentration of topic 9 within intermarginal scholia does not mean that the intermarginal scholia are the only scholia where there is any writing about Aristarchus.  First of all, it should be remembered that a "topic" is defined as words which co-occur frequently. Thus saying that a certain topic appears more in one zone over another only is saying that the particular pattern of co-occurring words identified by the topic model seems to occur more in one zone than another. So there may be other ways to talk about the writings of Aristarchus, but the analysis focusing on topic 9 is only dealing with one particular pattern which has been identified by the topic modelling software.

Additionally, it can be seen above that main and interior scholia still constitute fairly significant proportions of the scholia within the topic (32.61% and 20.29%, respectively). So to claim that this pattern of language appears *only* in the intermarginal scholia would be a distortion of the data. Instead, as claimed before, the data only suggests that the topic appears in the intermarginal scholia with a greater frequency than one would expect given the general frequency of the intermarginal scholia across the entire Venetus A.

That claim leads to one larger conclusion, however. By demonstrating that a topic can be distributed amongst the zones of the scholia differently than the general distribution of scholia across the manuscript, one shows that the different zones differ in what sort of topics are featured. So in this case, topic 9, a topic dealing with discussing Aristarchus, tends to be found more in the intermarginal scholia than in the main or interior scholia. By contrast, the previously mentioned topic 6, which discusses Zenodotus and Aristophanes separate from Aristarchus, seemed to have no preference for any of the zones. Thus, while not every topic seems to be zone-specific, the fact that some topics do have a preference for a zone points to the fact that the three zones of the scholia cannot be taken as being identical in their content.

What this ultimately seems to point to is the fact that the content of the main, interior, and intermarginal scholia must have come from different sources at some level. Virtually all of the data from this chapter of my thesis points to this conclusion. The difference in the scholia's length in number of words confirmed that the interlinear and exterior scholia were fundamentally shorter than the other three zones, while the main scholia were fundamentally longer than the other four zones, and the interior and intermarginal scholia were nearly identical in length, though the interior scholia tended to be half of a word longer than the intermarginal. It was seen that the practice of including a lemma at the beginning of a scholia was almost exclusively a feature of the main scholia, a finding which seemed to coincide with an understanding of how the other four zones utilized their proximity to the *Iliad* text in order to make clear what line they were commenting on, rendering the need for a lemma useless. An analysis of the types of discourse used by the scribe of the various zones revealed that the use of quoted text to cite a source beyond the line of the *Iliad* immediately being commented upon was a feature that occurred almost exclusively in the main scholia. Furthermore, there existed a significant difference in the rate at which the intermarginal and interior scholia made use of non-scribal voice, with intermarginal scholia making use of non-scribal voice more often. In any case, the discourse data illuminated the real possibility that the three zones of the scholia probably came from different sources since the very language with which they were composed was different. This initial conclusion about the different sources for the scholia were confirmed by an analysis of the appearance of personal names among the scholia zones. It was found that there were a number of names of grammarians, poets, and historians which appeared exclusively in the main scholia. Thus it seemed clear that part of the main scholia purpose was to explicitly make reference to outside sources and thus it came from a distinctly different source from the other four zones of the scholia. Finally, data from topic modelling all but confirmed what had been hinted at by the other forms of distant reading thus far: the content of the scholia zones is not evenly distributed and the zones are not identical in their function. The example of the "Aristarchus" topic with its disproportionate distribution demonstrates that there are specific patterns of language that occur with more frequency in certain zones than others. This, in combination with all the above evidence, points to there being specific sources for each of the five zones of the scholia. They are unique in their length, their use of language, and in their content.

Obviously more tests could be performed in order to validate further this conclusion, and also further tests could be done to identify what sort of scholia are unique to each zone. For example, it is now fairly clear that a scholion which references a poet will almost certainly be from the main scholia. However, it was also seen that topic 6, the topic discussing Zenodotus and Aristophanes separate from Aristarchus was a topic common to the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia. Thus, more tests could and should be performed in order to pinpoint more precisely what features are simply common to all the Venetus A scholia and which are zone-specific.

However, the ultimate goal of this thesis was never to perfectly identify all of these features. In fact, my conclusion that the various zones of scholia to the Venetus A derive from different sources is not exactly novel. It has simply reaffirmed that the five zones are fundamentally different in their format and content, which in turn hints at their being unique sources for each of these five zones. What is novel about this thesis is its methodology. The aim of this thesis was more to apply distant reading in order to reach a better understanding of the scholia to the Venetus A, since distant reading offers the ability to distance researchers from biases that inevitably arise when one tries to conduct close reading across so massive a corpus. It should be restated that the work of this chapter is work that could only have been in the last few decades. So to this end, this chapter of my thesis has demonstrated that distant reading is a worthwhile and fruitful research practice with regards to the Venetus A scholia. To conclude my thesis, the next chapter will briefly detail one further and more specific finding about the scholia of this manuscript which was made possible only through distant reading, it examines the relationship of the intermarginal and interior scholia.
