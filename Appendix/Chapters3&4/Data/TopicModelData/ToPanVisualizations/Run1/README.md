The results from the first run of the ToPan software, at 2,000 iterations, over the section of the Venetus A scholia used in this thesis can be found here. The [images folder](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/TopicModelData/ToPanVisualizations/Run1/Images) is where one can find the screenshots of each of the topics of the final topic model, while [topicLabels.csv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/TopicModelData/ToPanVisualizations/Run1/topicLabels.csv) is where one can find the labels which were assigned by the researchers to each of the topics. These label are an attempt to make sense of the clusters of frequently co-occurring words, i.e. topics, which the software identified.
