The previous chapter focused on applying distant reading to a rather general question, i.e. can any specific differences be found in the features and language of the five zones of the Venetus A. It was then concluded that while the results of such investigation were telling and pointed strongly to their being unique sources for each of the five zones, much remains for future research to pinpoint exactly what features and patterns of language are unique to the five zones of the scholia. Still, the previous chapter was able to demonstrate the usefulness of applying distant reading to the scholia in general.

By contrast, this chapter will focus on a more specific question. Namely, it seeks to answer whether the intermarginal and interior zones of the scholia are meant to be treated as separate zones or, as one scholar argues, should they be treated as zones carrying identical content.

This sort of question highlights the advantage of distant reading to separate scholars from innate biases and reach conclusions based solely on hard evidence. I say this because since my time working in the Homer Multitext project, never has it been explained to me why the scholia are divided into the intermarginal and interior scholia. Looking at the a single folio of the Venetus A below demonstrates how the Homer Multitext project has traditionally thought of these two zones of the scholia:

![12r](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/master/images/DSE2.JPG)

The above picture shows folio 12 recto. The zone on the folio highlighted in red represent the intermarginal zone while the zone in blue represent the interior zone. This division by the Homer Multitext project follows the divisions put forth by Hartmut Erbse in his 1969 edition of the scholia to the Iliad (xiv). However, Erbse's division is not the only division present in the history of scholarship on this manuscript. In Karl Dindorf's prior 1875 edition of the Venetus A scholia, he presents no difference between the scholia now referred to as intermarginal scholia and the scholia now referred to as interior scholia. According to Dindorf, there should be no separate red and blue zones as seen in the picture above, but they should be treated as a single zone.

Dindorf in his preface explicitly recognizes only three zones of scholia: marginal, intermarginal, and interlinear. Dindorf's "marginal" scholia are equivalent to the HMT's main scholia (seen above in yellow), and both have the same conception of what an "interlinear" scholion is (Dindorf, ix). Dindorf's description of intermarginal scholia is a bit harder to figure out. He writes that "very short scholia hold a middle place in between the marginal scholia and the *Iliad* text which we 'intermarginal' (Dindorf, vii). This short definition fits perfectly with the Homer Multitext definition of the intermarginal scholia, which can be seen in the previous photo in red. Dindorf, however, clarifies his definition saying, "that is, the intermarginal scholia are the scholia which have been inserted in the narrow space of the interior margin which remains in between the marginal scholia and the *Iliad* text" (Dindorf, vii). What is troubling about this description is the phrase "interior margin," which has a particular meaning according to the Homer Multitext conventions. To the HMT, "interior margin" refers only to the blue zones seen in the picture above. This is a seemingly contradictory definition, until one thinks about the Venetus A as a bifolio rather than as a manuscript consisted of individual folios:

![ImInt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/master/images/12v13rImInt.jpg)

In the above picture, the two red zones correspond to the same intermarginal zones and the two blue zones correspond to the same interior zones. As one can see in the bifolio spread, one the left, or verso, page, the intermarginal zone appears first then the interior, when reading left to right, while on the right, or recto page, the interior zone appears first then the intermarginal.

When Dindorf was looking at the manuscript in person, he would have been looking at it as a bifolio. Thus when he describes the intermarginal scholia as those which appear "in the interior margin between the text and the marginal scholia" one can see how this can be interpreted to mean both the red and blue zones in the above picture. For both technically are interior when compared to the main scholia, and in addition both are technically in between the text and the main scholia. However, in the case of the blue zones, this description does not make sense when viewing the manuscript as a single folio. One can see when viewing it as a bifolio, Dindorf included the blue interior scholia within his definition as intermarginal scholia since they technically lie in between the text and main scholia, just between the text and main scholia of the verso and recto pages. In other words, Dindorf seems to define "intermarginal" scholia as literally all the scholia which lie in between the marginal scholia of the verso and recto pages.

This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that Dindorf in his edition, he marks all the intermarginal scholia with an asterisk so as to avoid confusing main and intermarginal scholia (Dindorf, ix). When one looks at his edition, however, one notices that scholia which the HMT would call interior are marked with an asterisk alongside those which the HMT would also call intermarginal. Thus it is clear that, for Dindorf, the separation of scholia into interior and intermarginal scholia did not exist. There was only one zone called intermarginal, which was comprised of what is now both interior and intermarginal. In other words, by not acknowledging the existence of two different zones, Dindorf argues that there is no meaningful difference between what is now called interior and intermarginal scholia.

Dindorf is one of the foremost scholars when it comes to the Iliadic scholia, thus it is worth given his lack of division into intermarginal and interior scholia serious consideration. Thus the driving question of this chapter will be whether there is any evidence that this area of the Venetus A should be divided into intermarginal and interior.

It is easiest to combat Dindorf's initial thinking that there is no difference between the two zones. As seen in the last chapter, there is a significant difference just in the sheer frequency of intermarginal and interior scholia.

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia 
| --- | --- 
| Intermarginal Scholia | 1220 
| Interior Scholia | 819 

It would be unlikely that, were there no actual difference in the two zones, that one would observe there being roughly 1.5 times more intermarginal than interior scholia. If there truly was no difference, one would expect instead for there to be a nearly equal number of intermarginal and interior scholia.

Beyond just the frequency of scholia, the last chapter demonstrated a number of different ways in which these two zones were different. Interior scholia were found to contain more words on average than intermarginal scholia. Intermarginal scholia tended to use indirect discourse more than interior scholia, thus demonstrating the two differed rather fundamentally since they used language in fundamentally different ways. Finally, the two were shown to differ in terms of content. The distribution of topic 9, the Aristarchus topic, among the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia, revealed how that particular pattern of language was concentrated within the intermarginal scholia at a rate disproportionate with the frequency of scholia across the entire manuscript. Thus, it is clear, with little room for doubt, that the interior and intermarginal scholia cannot be considered as identical as Dindorf does.

Still, even if Dindorf's model has been proven to be incorrect by the evidence provided in the previous chapter, the evidence does not definitively prove that the model adopted by the Homer Multitext project is the correct one either. While it has been shown that the four zones across the bifolio cannot be considered identical, it is possible that there is a different and more correct way of modelling this area of the Venetus A than splitting it up into intermarginal scholia and interior scholia. For example, it is entirely possible that this area of the manuscript page should be more accurately divided into scholia which comment on the beginning of a line and scholia which comment on the end of a line. A picture of this proposed model in shown below:

![StartEnd](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/raw/master/images/12v13rSE.jpg)

One should notice that this is the same exact bifolio spread as shown above, except that in this picture the red and blue zones represent different zones of the manuscript. On each folio shown above, the text of the *Iliad* is situated in between the red and blue zones, and since Greek is read from left-to-right like English, the beginning of the *Iliad* line on each page lies next to the red zone while the end of the line lies next to the blue zone. This alternate model of these two zones of scholia is certainly plausible. Would it not make sense if a scholion were to comment on the last word of a line for it to be placed directly adjacent to the first word in the blue zone, and conversely if a scholion were to comment on the first word of a line for it to be placed directly adjacent to that first word in the red zone?

If nothing else, this alternate and fully plausible model forces one to challenge the assumed division of these scholia into intermarginal and interior scholia, something which has not been proven to be the correct model otherwise. So now with two competing models, it was necessary to collect data on the start-of-line, end-of-line model. The first data point, as above, is just the frequency of start-of-line and end-of-line scholia.

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia |
|:----------------|:------------------|
| Start of Line   | 1255              |
| End of Line     | 783               |

As one can see, the frequency of start and end scholia nearly mirrors the frequency of intermarginal and interior scholia. If the start and end model had no strength to it, one would expect there to be an equal number of start and end line scholia. However, the disproportionate number of start-of-line scholia suggests that there may be something to this model that has not been otherwise recognized. Still, this data point alone is not enough to lead to the conclusion about which model is better. At this point, both the intermarginal-interior model and the start-end model appear to have some validity for classifying this area of scholia.

Next, it was investigated whether start and end scholia also had some significant difference between their use of direct and indirect discourse. Below is a table showing the proportion of the two types of discourse within start and end of line scholia:

Scholia Type|Number of words in Indirect Discourse|Number of Words in Direct Discourse|Number of Words
---|---|---|---
Start of line|1182 (14.04%)|7234 (85.96%)|8416
End of line|635 (12.85%)|4306 (87.15%)|4941

The difference in the proportion of indirect discourse words is smaller than the difference between the proportions of indirect discourse words in intermarginal and interior scholia. And indeed, a Z-test for proportions did not find this difference to be significant, with a p-value of less than 0.05. However, it was only just barely not significant. While a score of 1.96 is need for significance, this difference warranted a score of 1.94. It is highly possible that the inclusion of the rest of the Venetus A might alter this data such that this difference actually become significant. Thus based on discourse data, one cannot definitely conclude that the start and end of line model is either inaccurate or invalid.

Finally, it was investigated whether start and end of line scholia differed at all in their content, or if finally content was one area which was identical between the two zones. Whereas in the last chapter there was an analysis of personal names which appeared in one zone or the other, this analysis was passed over entirely. Instead, I examined immediately the data from the topic model, searching for any odd patterns of scholia distribution amongst the main, start of line, and end of line scholia. So, again for reference, below is the general frequency of these three zones of the scholia across the Venetus A:

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia | Percentage of the Manuscript
| --- | --- | --- 
| Main Scholia | 3601 | 63.9%
| Start-of-line Scholia | 1255 | 22.3%
| End-of-line Scholia | 783 | 13.9%


Again, if the difference between start-of-line and end-of-line scholia were truly meaningless, then the distribution of scholia within each of the topics should roughly mirror the above frequency of scholia throughout the Venetus A. For almost all this topics this generally holds true. There were only three topics which did not obey the expected frequency distribution, wherein main scholia would constitute the largest proportion of the topic's scholia, start-of-line would constitute the second largest proportion, and end-of-line scholia would have the smallest proportions. These were topics 1, 6, and 9 which correspond to topics on accentuation, 
The work of Zenodotus and Aristophanes separate from Aristarchus, and the work of Aristarchus, respectively. In the case of topics 1 and 6, start and end of line scholia were seen to be represented equally in each of the two topics. Since one would expect, given the typical frequency distribution of start and end of line scholia, that there should be a larger proportion of start-of-line scholia, one can show that, at least in both cases, the topic seems to have a higher concentration within interior scholia than intermarginal scholia. In other words, the two zones do seem to differ in their content since the distribution of content does not follow the expected distribution of scholia across the Venetus A.

Strengthening this argument is the distribution of scholia which are closely associated with topic 9, the Aristarchus topic. In the previous chapter, topic 9 was instrumental in demonstrating that some of the content of scholia is zone-specific since topic 9 was disproportionately concentrated within the intermarginal scholia. Here too, the topic 9 is disproportionately more concentrated within the start-of-line than even the intermarginal scholia.

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia | Percentage of the Manuscript
| --- | --- | --- 
main scholia|45|32.61%
start scholia|73|52.9%
end scholia|20|14.49%

The 52.9% of the scholia which are strongly associated with topic 9 shows that it appears with far greater frequency within that topic than it does in the Venetus A, in general, where it only shows up with a frequency of 22.3%. So again, this point highlights the fact that the start-of-line and end-of-line model cannot be easily ignored. Clearly topic 9 is far more concentrated in the start-of-line scholia, suggesting that start-of-line and end-of-line scholia should also not be treated the same. 

So at this point, it appears that both models are completely valid ways of divvying of this area of the Venetus A manuscript. Both the intermarginal-interior and the start-end models presents models which allow for two clearly distinct zones with obvious differences in language and content. However, just because two models work does not mean that both are correct. In fact, the start-end model seems to be merely mirroring almost exactly the data from the intermarginal-interior model. So, if one were to assume that the intermarginal0inteerior model were the correct model, then whatever similar observations are made about the differences between the start-of=line and end-of-line scholia is merely observing same exact observations just categorized different. The same can be said about the observed differences between intermarginal and interior scholia if the start-end model were assumed to be true. Only by directly comparing the two models against one another can a conclusion about which model is better and therefore how best to label this area of the manuscript page.

In order to directly compare these two models, I decided to strip away all assumptions about the four columns which were being classified as being either belonging to the intermarginal-interior model or the start-end model. Once these four columns were isolated, the features of the individual columns could be analyzed and their features could be compared to the two existing models. If there seemed to be a model that the features of the four independent columns fit better with, than that model must be the correct way to classify these four columns. For the sake of clarity, the picture below demonstrates how these four columns will be referred to in the upcoming analysis.

![StartEndImInt](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/raw/master/images/StartEndImInt.jpg)

The labels are simply the composite of that columns identity under the two possible models. So the leftmost column is considered an intermarginal scholion in the intermarginal-interior model and a start-of-line scholion in the start-end model.

As for which analysis would be most effective, it was decided that the discourse analysis would be the most effective way to illustrate which of the models was better suited for the four columns. While using the topic model data offers slightly more understandable data, a systematic analysis would require taking into account all 15 topics. The discourse analysis would just be comprised of two variables: frequency of words in direct discourse and frequency of words in indirect discourse. As stated above, this discourse analysis gives a hint at the sources behind the various zones of scholia. If zones differ in how frequently they utilize quotations, this suggests that they came from different sources since a fundamental unit of composing a scholion, quoting text, is different. Thus below is a table showing the use of direct and indirect discourse in each of the four columns of this area of the manuscript.


| Scholia zone | Words in direct discourse | Words in indirect discourse | Total words in zone |
|:-------------|:--------------------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------|
| Start Im     | 3849 (84.02%)             | 732 (**15.98%**)            | 4581                |
| End Int      | 1668 (90.36%)             | 178 (**9.64%**)             | 1846                |
| Start Int    | 3385 (88.27%)             | 450 (**11.73%**)            | 3835                |
| End Im       | 2638 (85.23%)             | 457 (**14.77%**)            | 3095                |

Initial analysis reveals an interesting pattern. The frequencies of indirect discourse words in the two intermarginal columns (start im & end im) differ by only 1.21%. The corresponding frequencies in the two interior columns (start int & end int) differ only by 2.09%. By contrast the two start columns (start im & start int) differ in frequency of indirect discourse words by 4.25% while the two end columns (end im & end int) differ in their frequencies by 5.13%. Thus it appears that the intermarginal-interior model is stronger than the start-end model, since the frequencies associated with the intermarginal-interior model appeared more similar than those of the start-end model. However, it should be noted that the differences are slight, and one may wonder if the 2.09% difference between the frequencies of the two interior columns is really that much better an indicator of similarity than the 4.25% difference between the frequencies of the two start columns. 

In order to test this, a Z-test for proportions was carried out in order to compare the difference in frequencies between the start, end, intermarginal, and interior columns. The results of this test are shown below:


| Columns Being Compared | Z-Score | Significance (p < 0.01)       |
|:---------------------|:--------|:------------------------------|
| Start Columns | 5.58    | Statistically Significant      |
| End Columns    | 5.21    | Statistically Significant      |
| Intermarginal Columns   | 1.44    | Not Statistically Significant |
| Interior Columns  | 2.35    | Not Statistically Significant |

In order to achieve significance, the test needed to result in a Z-score of at least 2.576, which corresponds at a p-value of less than 0.01, meaning that the chances of getting this result by chance are less than 1%. As one can see, the initial conclusions began above were completely confirmed by running the Z-test. The difference in frequency among the start and end columns was statistically significant, meaning that one could not treat them as being identical. In other words, it would be incorrect to view the four columns as corresponding to a start-end model. On the contrary, the difference in frequency among the intermarginal and interior columns was not significant, meaning that one could treat them as being identical. In other words, the intermarginal-interior model can be appropriately applied to these four columns of the Venetus A.

Thus in the end, that data demonstrate that not only was Dindorf's treatment of these four columns as identical incorrect, but more the traditional HMT approach to divide them into intermarginal and interior scholia has been confirmed by distant reading. On the surface, this does not appear that grand of a conclusion since, in essence, it merely confirmed what was already assumed to be true. However, in this case it is worth noting that, were the start-end model found to be the more accurate representation of those four zones, such a finding would completely disrupt nearly ten years of work by the Homer Multitext project who had been incorrectly classifying these four columns all along. Luckily, that did not happen here and the HMT standards for editing do not have to be changed in light of this research. Still, that counter-example speaks to the importance and power of distant reading as a tool to distance scholars from any and all assumptions about a text. While I had always assumed that the HMT division of the scholia into five distinct zones was correct, Dindorf clearly thought otherwise. This chapter demonstrated how applying distant reading to such a conflict of assumptions can successfully reach a clear solution free of the biases inherent in close reading.

Here, though, it should be noted, though albeit anecdotally, that there are countless examples of interior and intermarginal scholia which appear at the beginning of the line but do not comment on their beginning. The same goes for those interior and intermarginal scholia which appear at the end of the line. Thus, in some sense, it is a relief to find out that the start-end model was ultimately found inferior to the interior-intermarginal model this latter model would not conflict this observation that frequently intermarginal and interior scholia comment on more than the words which are immediately adjacent to them.

One final thing should be said about the start-end model before concluding this chapter. Its validity was completely unexpected. When running these initial tests, I was frankly shocked to see the frequencies of start and end scholia virtually mirror the frequencies of intermarginal and interior scholia. Even if it has been shown that the four columns of scholia surrounding the *Iliad* text follow an intermarginal-interior model, there is an undeniable tendency of the scribe of the Venetus A to annotate the beginnings of a line. If it can be assumed from the previous chapter that the intermarginal and interior derive from distinct sources, then the tendency to annotate the beginnings of lines seems to hint at a third source which may have been common to both the interior and intermarginal scholia. Whenever this third source was encountered, the scribe seems to have systematically placed it at the beginning of the line.

This is just a hypothesis, and much more analysis would have to be conducted concerning the intermarginal and interior scholia before any firm conclusions could be made as to why this tendency to annotate the beginnings of lines exists. In the meantime, this thesis ends with an acknowledgement that above all else this research accomplished exactly what it set out to do. The first chapter of this thesis began with a discussion of format to a text in general, and the rest of the thesis, particularly chapters 3 and 4 were focused on what features of language could be extracted from the scholia in order to better understand the Venetus A's own format. In the end, there were few groundbreaking discoveries, mostly confirming things which were assumed to be true. The different and groundbreaking part of this thesis was that before this thesis there were a number of things which might be assumed to be true, but could not be proven to be true. Now however, I can say with confidence that having a lemma is a clear marker of a main scholion. As is talking about Ptolemy of Ascalon. I can say with confidence that the HMT division of scholia in intermarginal and interior scholia is an accurate reflection of these two zones use of language. I can say with confidence that, based on linguistic and thematic differences, all five zones of the Venetus A clearly function differently and most likely came from different sources.

Much work needs to be done still to isolate further the specific features which make each of the zones unique and from there possibly determine the source for each of the scholia. This thesis hopefully laid the methodological groundwork to answer such questions, especially by demonstrating the usefulness of applying distant reading and digital technologies to any and all ancient and medieval texts.
