#Goals of HMT

>The Homer Multitext project seeks to present the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey in a critical framework that accounts for the fact that these poems were composed orally over the course of hundreds, if not thousands of years by countless singers who composed in performance.

Two scholia commenting on the same word 

!{main scholion}[urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA181VN-0683@0.224,0.3636,0.229,0.1195]

Main scholion: [The mark is here] because it is Homeric to understand [the word] â€œÏ„á½·Ï‚â€ instead of [writing] â€œÎ³Î½Î¿á½·Î· Ï„á½·Ï‚ á¼‚Î½â€. For it is also accustomed since the person is not being assumed; hence the word happens to be used in this way: â€œÎ¿á½Î´Îµ ÎºÎµ Ï†Î±á½·Î·Ï‚â€ instead of â€œÏ†Î±á½·Î· Ï„á½·Ï‚ á¼‚Î½.â€

Inner scholion: Aristophanes separately has â€œÎ³Î½Î¿á½·Î·â€ without the â€œÏ‚â€

- Why are there two comments on this one line?

- What does this indicate about the source material for the various types of scholia?

#Conclusions#

When we examine the scholia, we encounter indications of multiple sources, both scholiastic and textual.
