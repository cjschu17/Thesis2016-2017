Reading this thesis is more than just becoming more familiar with the *Iliad*, its history of scholarship, and newer developments in the digital era. More generally, reading this thesis begins the process of engaging with a text. Like all texts, this thesis has two primary components: the textual content and its formattting or presentation. While the content should reign as king in an undergraduate research thesis, the formatting is just as important for relaying the information contained within these pages. 

Admittedly, the presentation of my information is not particularly noteworthy, and thus it may appear that claiming my presentation to be as important as my content is a bit far-fetched. On the contrary, my presentation is not noteworthy precisely because I chose to present my content in the exact same way as countless others have before me. That is, I am writing text in a single conlumn that will extend onto many pages whose text will be split up into paragraphs. There may even be a footnote or two on a page, whose appearance in a smalelr type-font at the bottom of the page would attract the eyes of only the few most interested. Overall, most readers probably would never register that there was intentional formatting of this material since it is taken for granted that if someone wants to present book's worth of information, they do so in this manner of publication that has been standard for centuries.

I raise the reader's attention to the now-standard method of creating books in print precisely because the primary sources at the heart of this thesis have anything but a "standard"[^test]
