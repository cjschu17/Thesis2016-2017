The five zones of the Venetus A look different. Beyond their obviously different locational differences on the manuscript page, some are written in a different style of handwriting, and the average length of a single scholion differs quite dramatically. An interlinear scholion typically has no more than a few words, while some main scholia take up the entirety of the upper margin. However, it is entirely possible that these differences are coincidental or unimportant. Does it really make a difference that the main scholia and intermarginal scholia differ in handwriting styles (Hecquet, 79-80)? What scholars want to know about the placement of a comment within a particular zone of the scholia is the information, "presumably about the source(s) of the comment" which is conveyed by its placement (Ebbot, 2012). For example, are many intermarginal scholia really just abbreviated versions of main scholia, as Dindof asserts (CITE).

The previous approach to answering such a question, close-reading, was shown to be inadequate in accomplishing this. Thus a more distant reading is required which, as defined by Mattew Jockers, requires scholars to approach the text of interest as a sort of bag of words waiting to be analyzed in order to highlight patterns of language which would remain hidden to the average human eye. This is particularly important when corpora are exceedingly large, thereby straining
