Understanding how a text is formatted is absolutely essential to understanding its contents. Paragraph breaks and chapter divisions, for example, shape how a reader understands a novel. For the Venetus A manuscript, a tenth-century C.E. manuscript of the *Iliad*, its format is largely not understood. Each page of the manuscript contains both lines from the poem and scholia, or scholarly footnotes, which surround the text and provide commentary. These scholia are divided into five distinct zones on each manuscript page, but the precise function of each zone is never explained. This thesis seeks to apply methods of distant reading in order to form a better understanding of how these five zones interact. Distant reading, as opposed to close reading, requires the use of a computer to run broad statistical analyses, like topic modelling, across large corpora of texts. This thesis focused mainly on the relationship of three zones of scholia: main, intermarginal, and interior zones. In the end, methods of distant reading were able to demonstrate that these three zones differed significantly in their content, but they also differed in the style to such an extent that each of these three zones most likely came from its own separate source tradition. Thus, as regards the format of the manuscript, one should never treat these five zones as being equivalent, but one should treat each zone as its own separate document with its own function, style, and history.
