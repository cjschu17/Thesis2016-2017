While the previous chapter focused on applying distant reading to a rather general question, i.e. can any specific differences be found in the features and language of the five zones of the Venetus A. It was then concluded that while the results of such investigation were telling and pointed strongly to their being unqiue sources for each of the five zones, much remains for future research to pinpoint exactly what features and patterns of language are unique to the five zones of the scholia. Still, the previous chapter was able to demonstrate the usefulness of applying distant reading to the scholia in general.

By contrast, this chapter will focus on a more specific question. Namely, it seeks to answer whether the intermarginal and interior zones of the scholia are meant to be treated as separate zones or, as one scholar argues, should they be treated as zones carrying identical content.

This sort of question highlights the advantage of distant reading to separate scholars from innate biases and reach conclusions based solely on hard evidence. I say this because since my time working in the Homer Multitext project, never has it been explained to me why the the scholia are divided into the intermarginal and interior scholia. Looking at the a single folio of the Venetus A below demonstrates how the Homer Multitext project has traditionally thought of these two zones of the scholia:

The above picture shows folio 12 recto. The zone on the folio highlighted in red represent the intermarginal zone while the zone in blue represent the interior zone. This division by the Homer Multitext project follows the divisions put forth by Hartmut Erbse in his 1969 edition of the scholia to the Iliad (CITE). However, Erbse's division is not the only division present in the history of scholarship on this manuscript. In Karl Dindorf's prior 1875 edition of the Venetus A scholia, he presents no difference between the scholia now referred to as intermarginal scholia and the the scholia now referred to as interior scholia. According to Dindorf, there should be no separate red and blue zones as seen in the picture above, but they should be treated as a single zone.

Dindorf in his preface explicitly recognizes only three zones of scholia: marginal, intermarginal, and interlinear. Dindorf's "marginal" scholia are equivalent to the HMT's main scholia (seen above in yellow), and both have the same conception of what an "interlinear" scholion is (Dindorf, ix). Dindorf's description of intermarginal scholia is a bit harder to figure out. He writes that "very short scholia hold a middle place in between the marginal scholia and the *Iliad* text which we 'intermarginal' (Dindorf, vii). This short definition fits perfectly with the Homer Multitext definition of the intermarginal scholia, which can be seen in the previous photo in red. Dindorf, however, clarifies his definition saying, "that is, the intermarginal scholia are the scholia which have been inserted in the narrow space of the interior margin which remains in between the marginal scholia and the *Iliad* text" (Dindorf, vii). What is troubling about this description is the phrase "interior margin," which has a particular meaning according to the Homer Multitext conventions. To the HMT, "interior margin" refers only to the blue zones seen in the picture above. This is a seemingly contradictory definition, until one thinks about the Venetus A as a bifolio rather than as a manuscript consisted of individual folios:

In the above picture, the two red zones correspond to the same itnermarginal zones and the two blue zones correspond to the same interior zones. As one can see in the bifolio spread, one the left, or verso, page, the intermarginal zone appaers first then the interior, when reading left to right, while on the right, or recto page, the interior zone appears first then the intermarginal.

When Dindorf was looking at the manuscript in person, he would have been looking at it as a bifolio. Thus when he describes the intermarginal scholia as those which appear "in the interior margin between the text and the marginal scholia" one can see how this can be interpreted to mean both the red and blue zones in the above picture. For both technically are interior when compared to the main scholia, and in addition both are technically in between the text and the main scholia. However, in the case of the blue zones, this description does not make sense when viewing the manuscript as a single folio. One can see when viewing it as a bifolio, Dindorf included the blue interior scholia within his definition as intermarginal scholia since they technically lie in between the text and main scholia, just between the text and main scholia of the verso and recto pages. In other words, Dindorf seems to define "intermarginal" scholia as literally all the scholia which lie in between the marginal scholia of the verso and recto pages.

This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that Dindorf in his edition, he marks all the intermarginal scholia with an asterisk so as to avoid confusing main and intermarginal scholia (Dindorf, ix). When one looks at his edition, however, one notices that scholia which the HMT would call interior are marked with an asterisk alongside those which the HMT would also call intermarginal. Thus it is clear that, for Dindorf, the separation of scholia into interior and intermarginal scholia did not exist. There was only one zone called intermarginal, which was comprised of what is now both interior and intermarginal. In other words, by not acknowledging the existence of two different zones, Dindorf argues that there is no meaningful difference between what is now called interior and intermarginal scholia.

Dindorf is one of the foremost scholars when it comes to the Iliadic scholia, thus it is worth given his lack of division into intermarginal and interior scholia serious consideration. Thus the driving question of this chapter will be whether there is any evidence that this area of the Venetus A should be divided into intermarginal and interior.

It is easiest to combat Dindorf's intital thinking that there is no difference between the two zones. As seen in the last chapter, there is a significant difference just in the sheer frequency of intermarginal and interior scholia.

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia 
| --- | --- | --- 
| Intermarginal Scholia | 1220 
| Interior Scholia | 819
