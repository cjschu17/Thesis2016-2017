This script is designed to present descriptive and analytic statistics regarding the differences in length (as measured by words per scholion) among the scholia of the different zones.

It requires only one input: the [archival version of the scholia](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/VersionsOfScholia/archived-version.tsv).

The result of this script is a text file with two tables. The first table is a table of all the descriptive statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) for this dataset. This table can be found in the data section for Chapter 3, [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/scholiaLength.tsv). The second table is a compilation of the results of the Student's T-test along with whether the difference in average scholion length between two zones was statistically significant or not. This table can also be found in Chapter 3's data appendix, found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/tTestResults.tsv).

Similarly, the script [startEndDescriptiveStats.sc](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3&4/Scripts/WordLengthOfScholia/startEndDescriptiveStats.sc) is an executable script meant to compare the intermarginal/interior model and start-of-line/end-of-line model of the scholia by analyzing their descriptive statistics. Specifically this script looks at how the four individual columns of scholia which can be classified by either model compare in terms of length of scholia in words. 

This script requires 2 inputs. First it requires a index of every scholia to the folio it appears on in order to first classify each scholion as either start-of-line or end-of-line. Such an index can be found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/StartEndIdentification/scholToFolioIndx.csv). The second input is the HMT's archival edition of the Venetus A found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/VersionsOfScholia/archived-version.tsv). There are also two results of the script. The first is the table of descriptive statistics for the start-of-line/end-of-line scholia found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/startEndScholLengths.tsv). Since the script also runs analytical statistics, the Z-scores associated with comparing the length of the start-of-line and end-of-line scholia is also the result of this script. This can be found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/startEndTTest.tsv).
