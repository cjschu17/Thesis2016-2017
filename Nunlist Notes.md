##Intro

Literary criticism is divided into treatises vs. scholia (2)

Treatises often offer more theory and fewer examples, while scholia can comment on an entire corpus, providing continuous commentary and a fuller viewpoint

(3) books is clustered by topic, irrespective of exact terminology as the terminology differs from MS to MS

(11) lemma do not always quote the exact part being commented on - may just be teh beginning of the line
scholia harshly abbreviated - 
Can often be used to just note differences in parallel passages

Can refers to a lively debate over what are and are not contradictions

Can discuss whether things are characteristic of the works author (ἔθος)

Many scholia take on question and answer (ζητήματα καὶ λύσεις)  format (διὰ τί... ὅτι)

(12) Scholia written for readers, even in the case of Greek plays.

Polemics are not rare and reflect the work of previous scholars

Scholia introduced by ἄλλως or ἤ generally present alternatives without showing any preference.

Besides lit crit: semantics and syntax; textual criticism - athetization, etc.

(17-18) Four ways to determine source of scholia:

- direct attribution to a scholia
- *subscriptio* lists the sources
- scholion's diction chracteristic of a particular school
- the point made in the scholion is characteristic of a school

Nunlist expressly warns against using σημειωτέον ὅτι as being definitive proof for Aristonicus.
