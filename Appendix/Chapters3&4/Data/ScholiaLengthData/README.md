Here are located the various tables for data associated with quantifying the length of scholia by the number of words they contain. There are only two tables associated with this line of inquiry. This contains data related to both the third and fourth chapters.

The table, [scholiaLength.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/scholiaLength.tsv), has five rows (one for the main scholia, one for the interior scholia, etc.), and in each row the table presents how many scholia there are of that type, what the mean length (in words) of scholia within that type, what is the median length (in words) of scholia within that type, and what is the standard deviation of the lengths of scholia within that type.

The table, [startEndScholLengths.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/startEndScholLengths.tsv) is identical in format to [scholiaLength.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/scholiaLength.tsv), but [startEndScholLengths.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/startEndScholLengths.tsv) presents data from the fourth chapter. In other words, this table is concerned with whether the interior/intermarginal or start/end model of the scholia is a better representation of those zones of the scholia. Thus, in the first column instead of "main," "intermarginal," etc. the table presents data for "start im," "end im," "start int," and "end int" where each label represents one zone of the manuscript where the two models overlap. For example, the "start im" row of this table presents data related to the part of the manuscript which could be considered both part of the intermarginal scholia and also located adjacent to the start of the line of text.

The table, [tTestResults.csv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/tTestResults.tsv), contains three columns and presents the results of the analytic T-test which is used to determine whether two datasets are significantly different or not. The first is a label detailing which two zones of the scholia are having their mean length (in words) compared (Main and Intermarginal, e.g.). The second column presents the T-score the T-test creates, and the final column presents whether the two zones being compared have a statisically significant difference or not based on the T-score in the second column. A p<0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

Similar to [tTestResults.csv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/tTestResults.tsv) is [startEndTTest.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/startEndTTest.tsv). Like the relationship of [startEndScholLengths.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/startEndScholLengths.tsv) to [scholiaLength.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/scholiaLength.tsv), [startEndTTest.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/startEndTTest.tsv) presents the exact same kind of data as [tTestResults.csv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/tTestResults.tsv), except that instead of focusing on all the zones of the scholia, [startEndTTest.tsv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/ScholiaLengthData/startEndTTest.tsv) is only focused on comparing the zones of the manuscript that can be fall within both the intermarginal/interior and start/end models of scholia.
