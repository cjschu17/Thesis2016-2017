Understanding how a text is formatted is essential to understanding its contents. Paragraph breaks, for example, shape how a reader understands a novel. However, the purpose of the layout for the Venetus A manuscript, an important tenth-century C.E. manuscript of the *Iliad*, is not understood well. Each page of the manuscript contains both lines from the poem and scholia, or scholarly footnotes, which surround the text and provide commentary. These scholia are divided into five distinct zones, but the precise function of each zone is never explained. This thesis seeks to apply methods of distant reading in order to better understand of how these five zones function. Distant reading, as opposed to close reading, requires the use of a computer to run broad statistical analyses, like topic modelling, across large corpora of texts. This thesis focused mainly on the relationship of three zones of scholia: main, intermarginal, and interior zones. In the end, methods of distant reading were able to demonstrate that these three zones differed significantly in their content, but they also differed in the style to such an extent that each of these three zones most likely came from its own separate source tradition. With respect to reading the manuscript, the five zones should never be treated as being equivalent, but each zone stands alone as a separate document with its own function, style, and history.
