The data in this folder contains the results of two analyses of the Venetus A scholia by the ToPan topic modelling software. Both were run on the same day in April using the version of the scholia found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/VersionsOfScholia/TM-normalized.tsv) which was optimized for topic modelling. That means the text of the scholia was normalized according to paleography, orthography, and morphology and had many of the most frequently occurring words (i.e. [stop-words](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapters3%264/Data/TopicModelData/StopWords/stopWords.txt) ) removed from the text. For more information about the normalization process, please see [Chapter 2](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/ThesisWriting/Chapter2.md).
