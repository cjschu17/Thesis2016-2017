Here are the screenshots of the various topics which resulted from the second of two runs of the topic modelling software, ToPan, analyzing the section of the *Iliad* scholia used throughout this thesis. These pictures were the result of running the analysis with 5,000 iterations. Each picture is associated with a single topic. The labels given to each of these topics by the researchers can be found [here](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/TopicModelData/ToPan-4-6-17/Run2/topicLabels.csv).
