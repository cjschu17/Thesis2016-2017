## Data for Chapter 3: Applying Distant Reading to the Scholia

The data for chapter three are the result of applying the concept of distant reading discussed in [Chapter 2](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/ThesisWriting/Chapter2.md). There were five primary lines of inquiry made using distant reading which were employed to explore differences between the various zones of the scholia (that is, the main, intermarginal, interior, interlinear, and exterior zones).

The first was a look into just how each of the zones of the scholia differed in terms of length, as measured by the number of words per scholion. The data for this line of inquiry can be found in the [ScholiaLengthData folder](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/ScholiaLengthData).

The second inquiry was into how often a scholion began with a lemma, or quotation of the *Iliad* intended to help a reader know on which part of the text the scholion is commenting. This data can be found in the [LemmataData folder](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/LemmataData).

Next was the inquiry into the type of language used in the scholia. Namely, whether the individual words of a scholion were written in scribal voice or were quotations from another text or some other use of language that is clearly not scribal voice. If a word were being quoted in order to discuss its etymology, for example, it would be categorized as quoted language, and not part of scribal. A fuller explanation of scribal and non-scribal voice can be found in chapter 3, but data related to scribal and non-scribal voice can be found in the [VoiceTypeData folder](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/VoiceTypeData).

Then a first attempt was made into investigating the differencesin content among the various zones of the scholia by looking into the differences in the appearances of various names throughout the scholia. Data related to the frequency of names can be found in the [NameData folder](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/NameData).

Finally, the [TopicModelData](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/TopicModelData) contains all the data related to the use of the ToPan topic-modelling software to analyze the patterns of language inherent to the scholia.
