Reading this thesis is more than just becoming more familiar with the *Iliad*, its history of scholarship, and newer developments in the digital era. More generally, reading this thesis begins the process of engaging with a text. Like all texts, this thesis has two primary components: the textual content and its formattting or presentation. While the content should reign as king in an undergraduate research thesis, the formatting is just as important for relaying the information contained within these pages. 

Admittedly, the presentation of my information is not particularly noteworthy, and thus it may appear that claiming my presentation to be as important as my content is a bit far-fetched. On the contrary, my presentation is not noteworthy precisely because I chose to present my content in the exact same way as countless others have before me. That is, I am writing text in a single conlumn that will extend onto many pages whose text will be split up into paragraphs. Overall, most readers probably would never spend more than a few seconds pondering the formatting of this material since it follows the manner of publication that has been the standard for centuries. However, if I chose to write this thesis in two-columns without any paragraph breaks, I should not expect many people to read much beyond the first few lines.

In either case it should be clear that formatting matters when it comes to fashioning an effective text. I raise the reader's attention to the now-standard method of creating books in print precisely because the two texts which lie at the heart of this thesis apply methods of publication which were the standard in their own day, but far different from that of today. On the one hand is the epic poem the *Iliad*. In its modern incarnation, the *Iliad* runs about fifteen thousand lines as a printed text. The *Iliad*, however, was not originally a printed text; rather, its arose out of an oral tradition which dates back nearly three thousand years. 

On the other hand is the tenth-century C.E. Venetus A manuscript which contains one such written version of the *Iliad*, and one which is the oldest complete version in existence. As if its age were not impressive enough, each page of the manuscript is replete with a wealth of scholarly notes, or scholia, which provide a running commentary on the poem. These scholia are split up among five different margins of the manuscript such that they utterly surround the text on each manuscript page. This is a far cry from the modern system of footnoting which relegates similar scholarly notes to the bottom margin of the page, giving the impression that the footnotes are less important than the regular text. On the contrary the scholia of the Venetus A are so all-encompassing that it is hard to view them in the same dismissive light as modern footnotes.
