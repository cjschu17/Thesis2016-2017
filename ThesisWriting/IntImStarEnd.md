While the previous chapter focused on applying distant reading to a rather general question, i.e. can any specific differences be found in the features and language of the five zones of the Venetus A. It was then concluded that while the results of such investigation were telling and pointed strongly to their being unqiue sources for each of the five zones, much remains for future research to pinpoint exactly what features and patterns of language are unique to the five zones of the scholia. Still, the previous chapter was able to demonstrate the usefulness of applying distant reading to the scholia in general.

By contrast, this chapter will focus on a more specific question. Namely, it seeks to answer whether the intermarginal and interior zones of the scholia are meant to be treated as separate zones or, as one scholar argues, should they be treated as zones carrying identical content.

This sort of question highlights the advantage of distant reading to separate scholars from innate biases and reach conclusions based solely on hard evidence. I say this because since my time working in the Homer Multitext project, never has it been explained to me why the the scholia are divided into the intermarginal and interior scholia. Looking at the a single folio of the Venetus A below demonstrates how the Homer Multitext project has traditionally thought of these two zones of the scholia:

![12r](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/master/images/DSE2.JPG)

The above picture shows folio 12 recto. The zone on the folio highlighted in red represent the intermarginal zone while the zone in blue represent the interior zone. This division by the Homer Multitext project follows the divisions put forth by Hartmut Erbse in his 1969 edition of the scholia to the Iliad (CITE). However, Erbse's division is not the only division present in the history of scholarship on this manuscript. In Karl Dindorf's prior 1875 edition of the Venetus A scholia, he presents no difference between the scholia now referred to as intermarginal scholia and the the scholia now referred to as interior scholia. According to Dindorf, there should be no separate red and blue zones as seen in the picture above, but they should be treated as a single zone.

Dindorf in his preface explicitly recognizes only three zones of scholia: marginal, intermarginal, and interlinear. Dindorf's "marginal" scholia are equivalent to the HMT's main scholia (seen above in yellow), and both have the same conception of what an "interlinear" scholion is (Dindorf, ix). Dindorf's description of intermarginal scholia is a bit harder to figure out. He writes that "very short scholia hold a middle place in between the marginal scholia and the *Iliad* text which we 'intermarginal' (Dindorf, vii). This short definition fits perfectly with the Homer Multitext definition of the intermarginal scholia, which can be seen in the previous photo in red. Dindorf, however, clarifies his definition saying, "that is, the intermarginal scholia are the scholia which have been inserted in the narrow space of the interior margin which remains in between the marginal scholia and the *Iliad* text" (Dindorf, vii). What is troubling about this description is the phrase "interior margin," which has a particular meaning according to the Homer Multitext conventions. To the HMT, "interior margin" refers only to the blue zones seen in the picture above. This is a seemingly contradictory definition, until one thinks about the Venetus A as a bifolio rather than as a manuscript consisted of individual folios:

![ImInt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/master/images/12v13rImInt.jpg)

In the above picture, the two red zones correspond to the same itnermarginal zones and the two blue zones correspond to the same interior zones. As one can see in the bifolio spread, one the left, or verso, page, the intermarginal zone appaers first then the interior, when reading left to right, while on the right, or recto page, the interior zone appears first then the intermarginal.

When Dindorf was looking at the manuscript in person, he would have been looking at it as a bifolio. Thus when he describes the intermarginal scholia as those which appear "in the interior margin between the text and the marginal scholia" one can see how this can be interpreted to mean both the red and blue zones in the above picture. For both technically are interior when compared to the main scholia, and in addition both are technically in between the text and the main scholia. However, in the case of the blue zones, this description does not make sense when viewing the manuscript as a single folio. One can see when viewing it as a bifolio, Dindorf included the blue interior scholia within his definition as intermarginal scholia since they technically lie in between the text and main scholia, just between the text and main scholia of the verso and recto pages. In other words, Dindorf seems to define "intermarginal" scholia as literally all the scholia which lie in between the marginal scholia of the verso and recto pages.

This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that Dindorf in his edition, he marks all the intermarginal scholia with an asterisk so as to avoid confusing main and intermarginal scholia (Dindorf, ix). When one looks at his edition, however, one notices that scholia which the HMT would call interior are marked with an asterisk alongside those which the HMT would also call intermarginal. Thus it is clear that, for Dindorf, the separation of scholia into interior and intermarginal scholia did not exist. There was only one zone called intermarginal, which was comprised of what is now both interior and intermarginal. In other words, by not acknowledging the existence of two different zones, Dindorf argues that there is no meaningful difference between what is now called interior and intermarginal scholia.

Dindorf is one of the foremost scholars when it comes to the Iliadic scholia, thus it is worth given his lack of division into intermarginal and interior scholia serious consideration. Thus the driving question of this chapter will be whether there is any evidence that this area of the Venetus A should be divided into intermarginal and interior.

It is easiest to combat Dindorf's intital thinking that there is no difference between the two zones. As seen in the last chapter, there is a significant difference just in the sheer frequency of intermarginal and interior scholia.

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia 
| --- | --- 
| Intermarginal Scholia | 1220 
| Interior Scholia | 819 

It would be unlikely that, were there no actual difference in the two zones, that one would observe there being roughly 1.5 times more intermarginal than interior scholia. If there truly was no difference, one would expect instead for there to be a nearly equal number of intermarginal and interior scholia.

Beyond just the frequency of scholia, the last chapter demonstrated a number of different ways in which these two zones were different. Interior scholia were found to contain more words on average than intermarginal scholia. Intermarginal scholia tended to use indirect discourse more than interior scholia, thus demonstrating the two differed rather fundamentally since they used language in fundamentally different ways. Finally, the two were shown to differ in terms of content. The distribution of topic 9, the Aristarchus topic, among the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia, revealed how that particular pattern of language was concentrated within the intermarginal scholia at a rate disproportionate with the frequency of scholia across the entire manuscript. Thus, it is clear, with little room for doubt, that the interior and intermarginal scholia cannot be considered as identical as Dindorf does.

Still, even if Dindorf's model has been proven to be incorrect by the evidence provided in the previous chapter, the evidence does not definitively prove that the model adopted by the Homer Multitext project is the correct one either. While it has been shown that the four zones across the bifolio cannot be considered identical, it is possible that there is a different and more correct way of modelling this area of the Venetus A than splitting it up into intermarginal scholia and interior scholia. For example, it is entirely possible that this area of the manuscript page should be more accurately divided into scholia which comment on the beginning of a line and scholia which comment on the end of a line. A picture of this proposed model in shown below:

![StartEnd](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/raw/master/images/12v13rSE.jpg)

One should notice that this is the same exact bifolio spread as shown above, except that in this picture the red and blue zones represent different zones of the manuscript. On each folio shown above, the text of the *Iliad* is situated in between the red and blue zones, and since Greek is read from left-to-right like English, the beginning of the *Iliad* line on each page lies next to the red zone while the end of the line lies next to the blue zone. This alternate model of these two zones of scholia is certainly plausible. Would it not make sense if a scholion were to comment on the last word of a line for it to be placed directly adjacent to the first word in the blue zone, and conversely if a scholion were to comment on the first word of a line for it to be placed directly adjacent to that first word in the red zone?

If nothing else, this alternate and fully plausible model forces one to challenge the assumed division of these scholia into intermarginal and interior scholia, something which has not been proven to be the correct model otherwise. So now with two competing models, it was necessary to collect data on the start-of-line, end-of-line model. The first data point, as above, is just the frequency of start-of-line and end-of-line scholia.

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia |
|:----------------|:------------------|
| Start of Line   | 1255              |
| End of Line     | 783               |

As one can see, the frequency of start and end scholia nearly mirrors the frequency of intermarginal and interior scholia. If the start and end model had no strength to it, one would expect there to be an equal number of start and end line scholia. However, the disproprtionate number of start-of-line scholia suggests that there may be something to this model that has not been otherwise recognied. Still, this data point alone is not enough to lead to the conclusion about which model is better. At this point, both the intermarginal-interior model and the start-end model appear to have some validity for classifying this area of scholia.

Next, it was investigated whether start and end scholia also had some significant difference between their use of direct and indirect discourse. Below is a table showing the proportion of the two types of discourse within start and end of line scholia:

Scholia Type|Number of words in Indirect Discourse|Number of Words in Direct Discourse|Number of Words
---|---|---|---
Start of line|1182 (14.04%)|7234 (85.96%)|8416
End of line|635 (12.85%)|4306 (87.15%)|4941

While the difference in the proportion of indirect discourse words is smaller than the difference when comparing intermarginal and interior scholia, a Z-test for proportions still found this difference to be significant (CITE), thus based on discourse data, again one cannot conclude that the start and end of line model is an inaccurate or invalid one.

Finally, it was investigated whether start and end of line scholia differed at all in their content, or if finally content was one area which was identical between the two zones. Whereas in the last chapter there was an analysis of personal names which appeared in one zone or the other, this analysis was passed over entirely. Instead, I examined immediately the data from the topic model, searching for any odd patterns of scholia distribution amongst the main, start of line, and end of line scholia. So, again for reference, below is the general frequency of these three zones of the scholia across the Venetus A:

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia | Percentage of the Manuscript
| --- | --- | --- 
| Main Scholia | 3601 | 63.9%
| Start-of-line Scholia | 1255 | 22.3%
| End-of-line Scholia | 783 | 13.9%


Again, if the difference between start-of-line and end-of-line scholia were truly meaningless, then the distribution of scholia within each of the topics should roughly mirror the above frequency of scholia throughout the Venetus A. For almost all this topics this generally holds true. There were only three topics which did not obey the expected frequency distribution, wherein main scholia would constitute the largest proportion of the topic's scholia, start-of-line would constitute the second largest proportion, and end-of-line scholia would have the smallest proportions. These were topics 1, 6, and 9 which correspond to topics on accentuation, 
the work of Zenodotus and Aristophanes separate from Aristarchus, and the work of Aristarchus, respectively. In the case of topics 1 and 6, start and end of line scholia were seen to be represented equally in each of the two topics. Since one would expect, given the typical frequency distribution of start and end of line scholia, that there should be a larger proportion of start-of-line scholia, one can show that, at least in both cases, the topic seems to have a higher concentration within interior scholia than intermarginal scholia. In other words, the two zones do seem to differ in their content since the distribution of content does not follow the expected distribution of scholia across the Venetus A.

Strengthening this argument is the distribution of scholia which are closely associated with topic 9, the Aristarchus topic. In the previous chapter, topic 9 was instrumental in demonstrating that some of the content of scholia is zone-specific since topic 9 was disproportionately concentrated within the intermarginal scholia. Here too, the topic 9 is disproportionately more concentrated within the start-of-line  than even the intermarginal scholia.

| Type of Scholia | Number of Scholia | Percentage of the Manuscript
| --- | --- | --- 
main scholia|45|32.61%
start scholia|73|52.9%
end scholia|20|14.49%

The 52.9% of the scholia which are strongly associated with topic 9 shows that it appears with far greater frequency within that topic than it does in the Venetus A, in general, where is only shows up with a frequency of 22.3%. So again, this point highlights the fact that the start-of-line and end-of-line model cannot be easily ignored. Clearly topic 9 is far more concentrated in the start-of-line scholia, suggesting that start-of-line and end-of-line scholia should also not be treated the same.

So at this point, it appears that both models are completely valid ways of divvying of this area of the Venetus A manuscript. Both the intermarginal-interior and the start-end models presents models which allow for two clearly distinct zones with obvious differences in language and content. However, just because two models work does not mean that both are correct. Therefore, there needs to be a test in order to analyze which of the two models is a better approximation of the reality. Only by directly comparing the two models can a conclusion be made how best to label this area of the manuscript page.
