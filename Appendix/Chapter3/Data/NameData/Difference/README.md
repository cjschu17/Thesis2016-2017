These data tables present data regarding differences in the presence of personal names between the different types of scholia. So, for example, [imNoInt.csv](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/blob/master/Appendix/Chapter3/Data/NameData/Difference/imNoInt.csv), presents all the personal names which appear in the intermarginal scholia, but which do not appear in the interior scholia.
