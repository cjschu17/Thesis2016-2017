## Scala Scripts for Chapter 2: Text Citation and Text Wrangling ##

The scala scripts associated with Chapter 2 are those which were used in the creation of the specific versions of the Venetus A scholia. For this thesis, it was necessary to create a paleographically normalized (p-normalized), orthographically normalized (o-normalized), morphologically-normalized (m-normalized), and an edition suitable for topic modelling (TM edition). Editions of these versions can be found elsewhere in the appendix [here]().

Scripts necessary for the p-normalized text are not found in this appendix as they were developed by Neel Smith, and I simply had access to the final product, and not the scripts.

As topic modelling is discussed more extensively in Chapter 3, the scripts for creating the TM edition can be found [there]()

Here then, are the scripts required for the creation of the [o-normalized version](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter2/Scripts/creatingONormalizedText) and [m-normalized version](https://github.com/cjschu17/Thesis2016-2017/tree/master/Appendix/Chapter2/Scripts/creatingMNormalizedText).
